## 1. What are Ad-Hoc Commands?

Ad-Hoc commands are quick, "one-liner" tasks used to perform a single action on multiple managed nodes without writing a full Playbook. They are great for quick checks, updates, or reboots.

**Basic Syntax:**

```bash
ansible [group/host] -m [module] -a "[arguments]" -b
```

### Key Flags Breakdown

- **`-m [module]`**: Defines which module to run (e.g., `ping`, `yum`, `service`). If omitted, it defaults to `command`.

- **`-a "[options]"`**: Provides arguments to the module (e.g., package name, service state).

- **`-b` (Become)**: Runs the command with `sudo` privileges (essential for installing packages or changing system files).

- **`-i [inventory]`**: Specifies the inventory file path (optional if defined in `ansible.cfg`).

## 2. Connectivity & System Information

### 🔹 Ping All Hosts

Checks if Ansible can connect to the hosts via SSH and find the Python interpreter.

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

- **Why important?**: First step to verify your inventory and keys are working.

### 🔹 Check System Uptime

```bash
ansible all -m command -a "uptime"
```

- **Module `command`**: The default module. It runs simple commands but **doesn't support** variables like `$HOME` or operations like `|` (pipe) or `>`.

### 🔹 Gather Facts (System Details)

Collects detailed info (IP, OS version, CPU, Memory) about remote hosts.

```bash
ansible all -m setup
```

**Filter Specific Facts:** To see only specific info (e.g., only IP addresses):

```bash
ansible all -m setup -a "filter=ansible_default_ipv4.address"
```

- **Argument `filter`**: Limits the massive output to just what you need.

## 3. Package Management (Yum/Dnf/Apt)

### 🔹 Install a Package

Installs Nginx using the `yum` module.

```bash
ansible all -m yum -a "name=nginx state=present" -b
```

- **`name=nginx`**: The package name.

- **`state=present`**: Ensures the package is installed. (Use `state=latest` to update it).

- **`-b`**: **Crucial.** You cannot install packages without root/sudo access.

### 🔹 Remove a Package

```bash
ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -b
```

- **`state=absent`**: The standard Ansible way to say "Uninstall" or "Delete".

### 🔹 Upgrade All Packages

```bash
ansible all -m yum -a "name=* state=latest" -b
```

- **`name=*`**: Selects all packages.

- **`state=latest`**: Updates them to the newest version available.

## 4. Service Management

### 🔹 Start & Enable a Service

Starts Nginx and ensures it runs on boot.

```bash
ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=started enabled=yes" -b
```

- **`state=started`**: Starts the service if it's stopped.

- **`enabled=yes`**: Runs `systemctl enable`, checking the service starts after reboot.

### 🔹 Restart a Service

Useful after configuration changes.

```bash
ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" -b
```

### 🔹 Stop a Service

```bash
ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=stopped" -b
```

## 5. File & Directory Management

### 🔹 Create a Directory

```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/testdir state=directory mode=0755"
```

- **`state=directory`**: Tells Ansible to create a folder, not a file.

- **`mode=0755`**: Sets Linux permissions (rwxr-xr-x).

### 🔹 Create an Empty File (Touch)

```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/demo.txt state=touch"
```

- **`state=touch`**: Updates timestamp if file exists, or creates an empty one if it doesn't.

### 🔹 Copy File to Remote Hosts

Uploads a file from your Controller to the Managed Nodes.

```bash
ansible all -m copy -a "src=./local_file.txt dest=/tmp/remote_file.txt"
```

- **`src`**: Path on the **Controller** (your machine).

- **`dest`**: Path on the **Remote** (managed node).

### 🔹 Fetch File from Remote Hosts

Downloads a file from Managed Nodes to your Controller (Backup).

```bash
ansible all -m fetch -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=./backups flat=yes"
```

- **`flat=yes`**: Saves the file directly in the destination folder without creating a directory tree for every host.

### 🔹 Change Permissions/Ownership

```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/demo.txt owner=ec2-user group=ec2-user mode=0644" -b
```

- **Why `-b`?**: Changing ownership usually requires root if you don't own the file.

### 🔹 Delete a File or Directory

```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/file.txt state=absent"
```

- **`state=absent`**: Recursively deletes directories or unlinks files.

## 6. File Content Modification (Lineinfile)

### 🔹 Append a Line

Adds a line to a file if it doesn't exist.

```bash
ansible all -m lineinfile -a "path=/etc/motd line='Welcome to the server!'" -b
```

### 🔹 Replace a Line (Regex)

Search for a line and replace it (e.g., Disabling Root Login in SSH).

```bash
ansible all -m lineinfile -a "path=/etc/ssh/sshd_config regexp='^PermitRootLogin' line='PermitRootLogin no'" -b
```

- **`regexp`**: Regular expression to find the line.

- **`line`**: The text that should replace the found line.

## 7. User & Group Management

### 🔹 Create a Group

```bash
ansible all -m group -a "name=devops state=present" -b
```

### 🔹 Create a User

```bash
ansible all -m user -a "name=devops state=present" -b
```

### 🔹 Add User to a Group

Adds user `devops` to group `wheel` (sudoers) without removing them from other groups.

```bash
ansible all -m user -a "name=devops groups=wheel append=yes" -b
```

- **`append=yes`**: **Very Important!** If you forget this, the user will be removed from all other groups and _only_ be in `wheel`.

## 8. Shell & Script Execution

### 🔹 Shell Module (Complex Commands)

Use `shell` when you need pipes `|`, redirects `>`, or wildcards `*`.

```bash
ansible all -m shell -a "ls /var/log/*.log"
```

- **Difference**: The `command` module would fail here because it doesn't understand `*`.

### 🔹 Script Module (Run Local Scripts Remotely)

Executes a script located on your **Controller** machine on the **Remote** nodes. It copies it automatically, runs it, and then deletes it.

**1. Create the script locally (`deploy.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

**2. Run it via Ansible:**

```bash
ansible all -m script -a "./deploy.sh"
```
