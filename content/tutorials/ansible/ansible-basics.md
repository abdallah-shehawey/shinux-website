## 1. Introduction & Architecture

### Ansible Advantages

- **Agentless:** No daemons or agents installed on managed nodes (uses SSH).

- **Simple:** Easy to learn and read using YAML syntax.

- **Powerful:** Handles complex deployments, configuration management, and orchestration.

- **Repeatable:** Ensures consistent environments every time you run it.

- **Idempotent:** Tasks run only when needed (no changes if the state is already correct).

- **Extensible:** Can be extended using custom modules, plugins, and roles.

### Lab Architecture

This diagram shows how the **Controller** connects to the **Agents** using SSH.

```

## 2. Infrastructure Setup (AWS)

### Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances

Before installing anything, we need to create the servers on AWS.

1. **Launch 3 Instances:**

    - **OS:** Amazon Linux 2 or 2023.

    - **Instance Type:** t2.micro or t3.micro (Free tier eligible).

    - **Key Pair:** Create/Select one key pair (e.g., `ansible.pem`) and download it. **Use this same key for all 3 instances.**

    - **Security Group:** Ensure **Port 22 (SSH)** is open. Allow traffic from your IP and from the Security Group itself (for internal communication).

2. **Assign Roles:**

    - Instance 1 -> **Controller Node** (Where we run commands).

    - Instance 2 -> **Managed Node 1**.

    - Instance 3 -> **Managed Node 2**.

## 3. System Configuration

### Step 2: Configure Hostnames

Setting hostnames makes it easier to identify which server you are working on.

**A. Configure the Controller** Connect to the first instance via SSH and run:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ansible-controller
```

_Action: Log out (`exit` or `Ctrl+D`) and log back in to see the prompt change to `[ec2-user@ansible-controller ~]$`._

**B. Configure Agent 01** Connect to the second instance:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ansible-agent01
```

**C. Configure Agent 02** Connect to the third instance:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ansible-agent02
```

## 4. Ansible Installation & Setup

All following steps are performed **ONLY on the Ansible Controller Node**.

### Step 3: Install Ansible

We need to install the Ansible software engine on the controller.

```bash
sudo dnf install ansible -y
```

### Step 4: Prepare the Project Directory

It is best practice to keep your Ansible files in a specific folder.

```bash
mkdir ~/ansible-project
cd ~/ansible-project
```

### Step 5: Set Up SSH Key on Controller

Ansible needs the private key (`.pem` file) to log in to the managed nodes.

1. **Upload/Create Key:** Copy the content of your `ansible.pem` (from your local machine) to a new file named `your-key.pem` inside the `~/ansible-project` folder on the controller.

    - _You can use `nano your-key.pem`, paste the content, and save._

2. **Secure the Key:** SSH requires private keys to have strict permissions (read-only by owner).

    ```bash
    chmod 400 ~/ansible-project/your-key.pem
    ```

    _Explanation: If you don't do this, SSH will reject the key as "too open"._

## 5. Connecting Ansible to Nodes

### Step 6: Create Inventory File (`hosts`)

The inventory file tells Ansible which servers to manage and how to connect to them.

Create a file named `hosts`:

```bash
[web]
<node1_public_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/ansible-project/your-key.pem
<node2_public_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/ansible-project/your-key.pem
```

- `[web]`: This is a group name. You can run commands against all servers in this group.
 
- `<node1_private_ip>` public ip for node
 
- `ansible_user`: The default user for Amazon Linux is `ec2-user`.

- `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`: The path to the key we secured in Step 5.

### Step 7: Create Configuration File (`ansible.cfg`)

This file sets defaults so you don't have to type flags manually every time.

Create a file named `ansible.cfg` in the same directory:

```bash
[defaults]
inventory = ./hosts
host_key_checking = False
```

- `inventory`: Tells Ansible to look at the `hosts` file we just made.

- `host_key_checking = False`: Prevents the interactive "Are you sure you want to connect?" prompt, which is crucial for automation.

## 6. Verification

### Step 8: Test Connectivity

Now, let's verify that the Controller can talk to the Agents using the `ping` module.

```bash
ansible web -m ping
```

**Expected Output:** You should see a green "SUCCESS" message for both nodes.

```bash
172.31.x.x | SUCCESS => {
    "ping": "pong"
}
172.31.y.y | SUCCESS => {
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

_Note: This is not a network ping (ICMP); it verifies that Ansible can SSH into the node, find Python, and execute a script._
