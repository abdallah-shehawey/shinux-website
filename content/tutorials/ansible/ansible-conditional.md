A comprehensive guide to understanding and using **Conditionals** in Ansible. This document covers how to control task execution flow using the `when` statement, from basic checks to advanced logic.

## 🧠 What are Conditionals?

In automation, you don't always want to run every task on every server.

- **Scenario:** You want to install `httpd` on CentOS but `apache2` on Ubuntu.

- **Solution:** Use the `when` statement. It checks a condition (True/False). If **True**, the task runs. If **False**, the task is **Skipped**.

## 🚀 Part 1: Basic Examples (The Essentials)

### 1. Run Task Only on RedHat-Based Systems

This is the most common use case: handling different Operating Systems.

```yaml
- name: Install httpd only on RedHat
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **`ansible_os_family`**: A "Fact" gathered automatically by Ansible. It groups OS types (e.g., RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux are all "RedHat").

- **`==`**: The equality operator.

- **Logic:** "Only run this `yum` task if the OS family is exactly RedHat".

### 2. Run Task If Variable Matches Value

You can control flow using your own custom variables defined in the playbook or passed via CLI.

```yaml
- name: Install selected package
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    pkg_name: nginx  # Defining a variable
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: pkg_name == "nginx"
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **`vars`**: Defines a variable named `pkg_name`.

- **`when: pkg_name == "nginx"`**: Checks the value. If you changed `pkg_name` to `apache`, this task would be skipped.

### 3. Use 'when' with Hostname

Useful when you need to run a specific task on a specific node (e.g., only the Master node).

```yaml
- name: Show message only on server01
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print a message
      debug:
        msg: "This is server01"
      when: ansible_hostname == "server01"
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **`ansible_hostname`**: A built-in fact containing the short hostname of the server.

- **`debug` module**: Prints messages to the terminal (like `echo` in bash). Useful for testing conditions without changing the system.

### 4. Run Task If File Exists (Advanced Pattern)

This is a powerful pattern: Check something first, `register` the result, then use it.

```yaml
- name: Run only if file exists
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Check file
      stat:
        path: /tmp/test.conf
      register: file_status  # Saves the result of 'stat' into this variable

    - name: Remove file
      file:
        path: /tmp/test.conf
        state: absent
      when: file_status.stat.exists  # True if file was found
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **`stat` module**: Checks file details (size, permissions, existence).

- **`register: file_status`**: Stores the output of the `stat` task.

- **`file_status.stat.exists`**: This specific path inside the variable returns `true` or `false`.

- **Logic:** "If the file exists, delete it. If not, do nothing."

### 5. Use 'when' with OS Distribution

More specific than `os_family`. Use this when you care about the exact Distro (Amazon vs CentOS vs Ubuntu).

```yaml
- name: Install package depending on OS
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install package on Amazon Linux
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_distribution == "Amazon"
```

## 🔧 Part 2: Advanced Logic (Multiple Conditions)

### 1. The AND Operator

To run a task only if **multiple** conditions are true.

**Method A: List format (Recommended for readability)**

```yaml
when:
  - ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
  - ansible_memtotal_mb >= 1024
```

_Logic:_ Run ONLY if it is CentOS **AND** has more than 1GB RAM.

**Method B: String format**

```yaml
when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_memtotal_mb >= 1024
```

### 2. The OR Operator

To run a task if **at least one** condition is true.

```yaml
when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" or ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

_Logic:_ Run on RedHat OR Debian systems.

## 🛠️ Part 3: Controlling Task Status (Must Know!)

Sometimes a command fails, but you don't want Ansible to stop. Or a command runs successfully, but you don't want to report "Changed".

### 1. `failed_when` (Custom Failure)

Define what constitutes a "failure" for a task.

```yaml
- name: Check for error in log
  command: cat /var/log/app.log
  register: log_output
  failed_when: "'CRITICAL' in log_output.stdout"
```

- **Logic:** The command `cat` works fine (exit code 0), but we want to fail the playbook if the word "CRITICAL" is found in the text.

### 2. `changed_when` (Clean Output)

Commands usually report "Changed" every time they run. You can suppress this.

```yaml
- name: Verify nginx configuration
  command: nginx -t
  register: nginx_check
  changed_when: false  # Never report 'Changed', always report 'OK'
```

- **Why?** Running `nginx -t` doesn't change the server state; it just checks config. Reporting "Changed" is misleading.

## 🌟 Part 4: Conditionals with Loops

You can filter items in a loop directly using `when`.

```yaml
- name: Install packages only if they don't exist
  yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - httpd
    - mariadb
    - php
  when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

- **Logic:** The `when` statement is evaluated for **every item** in the loop. In this case, if the OS is not RedHat, the entire loop is skipped.

**Advanced Loop Condition:**

```yaml
- name: Create users based on group
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - { name: 'alice', type: 'admin' }
    - { name: 'bob', type: 'user' }
  when: item.type == 'admin'
```

- **Result:** Creates 'alice', skips 'bob'.

## 🎯 Summary Checklist

|Keyword|Use Case|
|---|---|
|**`when`**|The main conditional statement (If...Then).|
|**`==` / `!=`**|Equals / Not Equals.|
|**`and` / `or`**|Logical operators for multiple conditions.|
|**`is defined`**|Check if a variable exists (`when: my_var is defined`).|
|**`register`**|Capture task output to test it in the next task.|
|**`failed_when`**|Override default failure logic.|
|**`changed_when`**|Override "Changed" status (useful for read-only commands).|
