## 1. What is `ansible.cfg`?

It is the main configuration file for Ansible. It allows you to customize default behaviors so you don't have to provide flags (like `-i` or `-u`) every time you run a command.

**It controls settings such as:**

- Inventory location (default path for `hosts`).

- Remote user (the SSH user).

- Privilege escalation (sudo settings).

- SSH connection settings (timeouts, key checking).

## 2. Configuration File Precedence (Order of Operations)

Ansible looks for a configuration file in the following order. It uses the **first one it finds** and ignores the rest.

1. **`ANSIBLE_CONFIG` (Environment Variable):**

    - _Highest Priority._ Useful for temporary overrides.

2. **`./ansible.cfg` (Current Directory):**

    - _Most Common (Recommended)._ Used for project-specific configurations.

3. **`~/.ansible.cfg` (User Home Directory):**

    - User-specific defaults.

4. **`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` (System-wide):**

    - The global default (often created during installation).

## 3. How to Check Which Config is Active?

You can verify which configuration file Ansible is currently using by running the version command.

**Scenario A: Project Config Found (Recommended)** If you are in a directory that contains an `ansible.cfg`:

```bash
ansible --version
```

**Output:**

```bash
ansible [core 2.18.12]
  config file = /home/user/ansible-project/ansible.cfg
```

**Scenario B: Default Config Found** If no local file exists:

```bash
ansible [core 2.18.12]
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
```

**Scenario C: No Config Found** If no file exists in any search path:

```bash
config file = None
```

## 4. Common Configuration Sections

Here is a standard template for a project-level `ansible.cfg`.

### Section: `[defaults]`

General settings for Ansible execution.

```bash
[defaults]
# Location of the inventory file
inventory = ./hosts

# Default user to connect as (SSH user)
remote_user = ec2-user

# Disable SSH host key checking (useful for labs/automation)
host_key_checking = False

# Disable creation of .retry files when a job fails
retry_files_enabled = False

# for remove the warning that come after run playbook or module from another machine
interpreter_python=auto_silent

# SSH Connection timeout in seconds
timeout = 30
```

### Section: `[privilege_escalation]`

Settings for switching users (e.g., becoming root).

```bash
[privilege_escalation]
# Automatically switch user (sudo)
become = True

# Method to switch user
become_method = sudo

# User to switch to (usually root)
become_user = root
```

## 5. Essential Helper Commands

### Documentation (`ansible-doc`)

Ansible comes with built-in documentation for all modules. This is your offline manual.

- **List all available modules:**

    ```bash
    ansible-doc -l
    ```

- **Read documentation for a specific module (e.g., `user`):**

    ```bash
    ansible-doc user
    ```

- **Advanced Search (Filter for specific info like "AUTHOR"):**

    ```
    ansible-doc user | grep -i -A 2 "AUTHOR"
    ```

### Inventory Verification

Before running playbooks, verify that Ansible can see your hosts and groups correctly through the config.

- **List hosts in a specific group:**

    ```bash
    ansible <group_name> --list-hosts
    ```

    _Example:_

    ```bash
    ansible web --list-hosts
    ```

- **List all hosts in the inventory:**

    ```bash
    ansible all --list-hosts
    ```
