A comprehensive guide to creating, structuring, and using **Custom Roles** in Ansible. Roles are the best way to organize your code, making it reusable, shareable, and clean.

## What is an Ansible Role?

A Role is a package of automation. Instead of writing one giant playbook with 100 tasks, variables, and handlers, you split them into specific folders.

- **Analogy:** If a Playbook is a "Recipe", a Role is a "Pre-packaged Ingredient" (like a jar of sauce) that you just add to the recipe.

- **Benefits:**

  - **Reusability:** Write once, use in many playbooks.

  - **Structure:** Standardized directory layout.

  - **Sharing:** Easily shareable via Ansible Galaxy.

## Step 1: Create Role Structure (`ansible-galaxy`)

Ansible comes with a tool called `ansible-galaxy` that can "scaffold" (automatically create) the folder structure for you.

**Command:**

```text
ansible-galaxy init nginx
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **`ansible-galaxy`**: The CLI tool for managing roles.

- **`init`**: The command to initialize a new role structure locally.

- **`nginx`**: The name of the role you want to create.

- **Result:** It creates a folder named `nginx` in your current directory with all the standard subfolders (tasks, handlers, vars, etc.) ready for you to fill.

## Step 2: Project Directory Structure

After running the command, your project should look like this. Here is what every folder does:

```text
my-ansible-project/
├── inventory              # Your hosts file
├── site.yml               # The "Master" playbook
└── roles/
    └── nginx/             # The Role Directory
        ├── tasks/         # ✅ MAIN LOGIC: Steps to install/config
        │   └── main.yml   # The entry point for tasks
        ├── handlers/      # ✅ EVENTS: Restart logic
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── defaults/      # ✅ WEAK VARS: Default variables (easy to override)
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── vars/          # ✅ STRONG VARS: Variables meant to be constant
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── files/         # ✅ STATIC FILES: Files to copy (scripts, certs)
        ├── templates/     # ✅ DYNAMIC FILES: Jinja2 templates (.j2)
        └── meta/          # ✅ METADATA: Role info & dependencies
            └── main.yml
```

### Pro Tip: `defaults` vs `vars`

- **`defaults/main.yml`**: Use this for variables you want the user to allow changing easily (e.g., `nginx_port: 80`). They have **lowest** priority.

- **`vars/main.yml`**: Use this for variables internal to the role logic that shouldn't be changed often. They have **high** priority.

## Step 3: Define Tasks in Role

The `tasks/main.yml` file is the heart of the role. It executes the actual automation.

**File:** `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`

```text
---
# Task 1: Install the Package
- name: Install nginx
  yum:
    name: nginx
    state: present

# Task 2: Manage the Service
- name: Start and enable nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: true
```

### Argument Explanation

- **`yum` Module**:

  - **`name: nginx`**: The package name to install.

  - **`state: present`**: Ensures it is installed.

- **`service` Module**:

  - **`name: nginx`**: The service daemon name.

  - **`state: started`**: Ensures it's running right now.

  - **`enabled: true`**: **Crucial.** Ensures it starts automatically if the server reboots (systemctl enable).

## Step 4: Define Handlers (optional)

Handlers are used to restart services only when configuration changes.

**File:** `roles/nginx/handlers/main.yml`

```text
---
- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

### Argument Explanation

- **`name: restart nginx`**: This is the "Trigger Name". You must use this exact string in your tasks (e.g., `notify: restart nginx`).

- **`state: restarted`**: Stops and starts the service to apply new configs.

## Step 5: Create the Playbook (`site.yml`)

Now that the role is built, you need a Playbook to "call" or "use" it. This file is usually much shorter because the logic is hidden inside the role.

**File:** `site.yml` (in project root)

```text
---
- name: Apply nginx role to web servers
  hosts: all          # Target hosts from inventory
  become: true        # Run as root (sudo)
  roles:
    - nginx           # The name of the folder inside /roles/
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **`roles:`**: This section tells Ansible to look into the `roles/` directory, find a folder named `nginx`, and execute `tasks/main.yml`. It also automatically loads any vars, handlers, or defaults found inside that role.

## Step 6: Run the Playbook

Finally, execute the automation.

**Command:**

```text
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
```

### Argument Explanation

- **`ansible-playbook`**: The command to run YAML playbooks.

- **`-i inventory`**: Specifies the inventory file path.

- **`site.yml`**: The master playbook file.

## Summary Checklist for Custom Roles

1. **Init**: `ansible-galaxy init <role_name>`

2. **Tasks**: Write logic in `tasks/main.yml`.

3. **Handlers**: Write restart logic in `handlers/main.yml`.

4. **Vars**: Define defaults in `defaults/main.yml`.

5. **Playbook**: Call the role using the `roles:` section.

6. **Run**: Execute with `ansible-playbook`.

## Bonus: Finding Community Roles (ansible Galaxy Web)

You don't always have to write roles from scratch. You can find high-quality, pre-made roles on the official website.

**Website:** [https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/)

**Steps to find the best roles:**

1. **Visit the Site:** Go to the link above.

2. **Navigate:** Click on **Roles** in the menu.

3. **Search:** Type the technology you need (e.g., `redis`, `postgresql`, `docker`).

4. **Sort by Popularity (Crucial Step):**

    - By default, it might sort by "Created" (newest).

    - **Change the sort filter to "Download Count".**

    - _Why?_ This helps you find the most popular and battle-tested roles used by the community, rather than obscure or untested ones.

5. **Install:** Copy the installation command provided on the role page (e.g., `ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx`).
