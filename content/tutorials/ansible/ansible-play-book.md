This document provides a **comprehensive and detailed explanation** of Ansible Playbooks. It breaks down the syntax, logic, execution methods, and every single module used, designed to be a reference for beginners and pros alike.

## 🧠 Section 1: Introduction & Anatomy

### Why Use Ansible? (The Benefits)

Based on core principles, here is why Ansible is powerful:

- ✅ **Agentless**: No daemons or agents installed on nodes (uses SSH).

- ✅ **Simple**: Easy to learn with YAML syntax.

- ✅ **Powerful**: Handles complex deployments and orchestrations.

- ✅ **Repeatable**: Ensures consistent environments.

- ✅ **Idempotent**: Tasks run only when needed (no changes if state is correct).

- ✅ **Extensible**: Use custom modules, plugins, and roles.

### What is a Playbook?

An Ansible Playbook is a **YAML** file that describes a set of automation steps. Think of it as a "ToDo List" for your servers.

### Basic Structure Rules

1. **Starts with `---`**: This indicates the start of a YAML file.

2. **Hyphens (`-`)**: Indicate a list item (e.g., a Play or a Task).

3. **Indentation**: **Critical in YAML.** Use 2 spaces for indentation. Never use tabs.

### The "Play" Hierarchy

A Playbook contains one or more **Plays**.

- **Play**: Maps a group of hosts to a list of tasks.

  - **Hosts**: _Who_ are we automating? (e.g., `web`, `db`, `localhost`).

  - **Become**: _Do we need root?_ (sudo).

  - **Tasks**: _What_ are we doing? (The actual steps).

## 🧩 Section 2: Local Automation Example (Understanding Syntax)

This play runs locally on your machine, not on a remote server. It's great for testing.

```yaml
---
- name: Play 1 - Local Automation
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: Execute command 'date'
      command: date

    - name: Execute script on server
      script: test_script.sh

- name: Play 2 - Web Service Setup
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install web service
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start web server
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

### 🔍 Deep Dive into Part 1

1. **`hosts: localhost`**: Tells Ansible to run this play on the machine you are currently typing on (the Control Node).

2. **`connection: local`**: Optimizes the connection. Since it's the same machine, Ansible doesn't need to open an SSH tunnel.

3. **`become: true`**:

    - This is equivalent to typing `sudo` before a command.

    - Required for `yum` (installing packages) and `service` (starting daemons).

4. **`command` Module**:

    - Runs a raw Linux command.

    - _Note:_ It is **not idempotent**. If you run `mkdir folder`, it works once. If you run it again, it fails (folder exists). Use the `file` module for folders instead.

5. **`script` Module**:

    - Takes a script from your **local** machine (Control Node), copies it to the **remote** node, runs it, and then deletes it.

## 🧹 Section 3: The Logic of "Cleanup" (Decommissioning)

This example teaches you how to logically remove software. You can't just delete files; you must stop the process first.

```yaml
- name: Remove NGINX from Amazon Linux EC2
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    # 1. Stop the service first. We can't delete running programs safely.
    - name: Stop nginx service if running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: stopped
      ignore_errors: true

    # 2. Disable it so it doesn't try to start on reboot (ghost service).
    - name: Disable nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        enabled: no
      ignore_errors: true

    # 3. Now it's safe to uninstall the binary package.
    - name: Remove nginx package
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: absent

    # 4. Clean up configuration files (yum often leaves these behind).
    - name: Delete nginx configuration directory
      file:
        path: /etc/nginx
        state: absent

    # 5. Clean up data/website files.
    - name: Delete default nginx HTML directory
      file:
        path: /usr/share/nginx
        state: absent
```

### 🔍 Deep Dive into Cleanup Logic

- **`state: stopped`**: Stops the process immediately.

- **`enabled: no`**: Removes the symbolic link from systemd (systemctl disable).

- **`ignore_errors: true`**:

  - _Why?_ If Nginx is **already** uninstalled, the `service` module would normally fail saying "Service not found".

  - This flag tells Ansible: "Try to stop it, but if you fail (because it's not there), just keep going to the next task." This makes the playbook **Robust**.

- **`state: absent`**: The universal keyword for removal.

  - For `yum`: Uninstalls the package.

  - For `file`: Recursively deletes directories (like `rm -rf`).

  - For `user`: Deletes the user account.

## 📚 Section 4: Common Tasks Library

This section explains the most used modules in real-world DevOps scenarios.

### 🌐 Web & Services

#### **1. Install Apache (httpd)**

```yaml
- name: Install Apache Web Server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present      # Ensures it is installed. Use 'latest' to update.

    - name: Start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started      # Starts the service now.
        enabled: true       # Ensures it starts automatically after reboot.
```

#### **2. Restart SSH Service (Handler Pattern)

```yaml
- name: Restart SSH service
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Restart sshd
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted    # Stops and Start the service.
```

- _Use Case:_ You typically run this after modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

#### **3. Configure Firewall (Firewalld)

```yaml
- name: Open port 80 in firewalld
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Allow HTTP traffic
      firewalld:
        port: 80/tcp
        permanent: true     # Writes rule to disk (survives reboot).
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes      # Applies rule NOW (no reload needed).
```

- _Note:_ Without `immediate: yes`, the rule would only apply after a firewall reload or reboot.

#### **4. Start and Enable a Service (General)

```yaml
- name: Start and enable firewalld
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Start firewalld
      service:
        name: firewalld
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

### 👤 User & Access Management

#### **5. Create a User

```yaml
- name: Create a user called devops
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Add user devops
      user:
        name: devops
        state: present
        groups: wheel       # Adds user to 'wheel' group (sudoers).
        append: yes         # CRITICAL: If 'no', it removes user from all other groups!
```

#### **6. Delete a User (Deep Clean)

```yaml
- name: Remove user 'testuser'
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Delete testuser
      user:
        name: testuser
        state: absent
        remove: yes         # CRITICAL: Deletes /home/testuser and mail spool.
```

- _Why `remove: yes`?_ By default, Linux deletes the user account but keeps their files in `/home`. This flag ensures a clean wipe.

#### **7. Set Hostname

```yaml
- name: Set system hostname
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Change hostname to "web01"
      hostname:
        name: web01
```

### 📂 File & Directory Management

#### **8. Copy a File (Push)

```yaml
- name: Copy index.html to web server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file
      copy:
        src: ./index.html              # Source file on YOUR machine.
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html # Destination on REMOTE server.
```

#### **9. Create a Directory

```yaml
- name: Create directory on remote host
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Make /opt/demo
      file:
        path: /opt/demo
        state: directory    # Tells Ansible this is a folder, not a file.
        mode: '0755'        # rwxr-xr-x permissions.
```

#### **10. Set File Permissions & Ownership

```yaml
- name: Set permissions on a config file
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Set mode and ownership
      file:
        path: /etc/myconfig.conf
        mode: '0644'
        owner: root
        group: root
        state: file
```

#### **11. Remove a Directory

```yaml
- name: Remove temporary directory
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Delete /tmp/old_data
      file:
        path: /tmp/old_data
        state: absent       # Recursively deletes directory and contents.
```

#### **12. Modify File Content (Idempotent Edit)

```yaml
- name: Add banner to /etc/motd
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Add welcome message
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/motd
        line: "Welcome to your server - managed by Ansible"
```

- _Magic:_ `lineinfile` checks if the line exists first. If it does, it does nothing (Idempotent). If not, it adds it.

#### **13. Create an Empty File (Touch)

```yaml
- name: Create a log file
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Touch /var/log/app.log
      file:
        path: /var/log/app.log
        state: touch        # Like the Linux 'touch' command.
        mode: '0644'
```

### ⚙️ System Configuration

#### **14. Install EPEL Repository

```yaml
- name: Install EPEL repository
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install epel-release
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present
```

- _Why?_ Amazon Linux and CentOS often need "Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux" (EPEL) to install common tools like Nginx or htop.

#### **15. Mount a Volume

```yaml
- name: Mount a filesystem
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Mount /dev/xvdf1 on /mnt/data
      mount:
        path: /mnt/data     # Where to mount.
        src: /dev/xvdf1     # The device/disk.
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted      # Mounts NOW + Adds to /etc/fstab (Persist).
```

#### **16. Set System Timezone

```yaml
- name: Set timezone to UTC
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Configure timezone
      timezone:
        name: UTC
```

- _Why?_ Servers should always be in UTC to avoid log confusion across timezones.

#### **17. Add DNS Resolver

```yaml
- name: Add DNS server to resolv.conf
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Add Google DNS
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/resolv.conf
        line: "nameserver 8.8.8.8"
```

#### **18. Create a Swap File

This task involves multiple steps using `command` and `file`.

```yaml
- name: Create 1GB swap file
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create swap file
      command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=1024
      args:
        creates: /swapfile  # Crucial: Only runs if /swapfile doesn't exist

    - name: Set permissions
      file:
        path: /swapfile
        mode: '0600'

    - name: Make it swap
      command: mkswap /swapfile
      when: ansible_facts['swapfree_mb'] == 0 # Conditional execution

    - name: Enable swap
      command: swapon /swapfile
      when: ansible_facts['swapfree_mb'] == 0
```

#### **19. Reboot the Server

```yaml
- name: Reboot server after changes
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Reboot the machine
      reboot:
        reboot_timeout: 300 # Wait 5 minutes max for it to come back.
```

- _Magic:_ Ansible disconnects, waits for the server to restart, reconnects, and then continues the playbook.

## ⚡ Section 5: Advanced Execution Options

This section covers critical options for running playbooks efficiently and safely.

### 1. Verification & Dry Runs

- **Syntax Check**: Checks for YAML errors without running.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

- **Dry Run / Check Mode**: Simulates execution.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -C
```

### 2. Debugging & Verbosity

- **`-v`**: Show task results.

- **`-vvv`**: Show connection info (good for verifying SSH).

### 3. Controlling Execution Scope

- **Limit**: Run only on specific hosts/groups.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit db
```

- **Forks**: Control parallelism (default is 5).

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --forks 20
```

## 🚀 Section 6: Managing Multiple Playbooks & Workflows

As your infrastructure grows, putting everything in one file becomes messy. Here are the methods to manage complex workflows.

### Method 1: Multi-Play in One YAML File

You can define multiple plays in a single file (`multi_playbook.yml`), each targeting different groups.

```yaml
# Play 1: Target Web Servers
- name: Install Apache on web servers
  hosts: web
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

# Play 2: Target DB Servers
- name: Install MariaDB on db servers
  hosts: db
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install MariaDB
      yum:
        name: mariadb-server
        state: present
```

### Method 2: The Master Playbook (`import_playbook`)

Use this to statically include other playbooks. It acts as a "Parent" playbook that calls "Child" playbooks.

**File: `site.yml`**

```yaml
---
- import_playbook: web.yml
- import_playbook: db.yml
```

**Execution:**

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

### Method 3: Dynamic Task Inclusion (`include_tasks`)

Use this inside a task list to organize large plays.

**File: `main.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Common Setup
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Include web tasks
      include_tasks: web-tasks.yml

    - name: Include db tasks
      include_tasks: db-tasks.yml
```

**File: `web-tasks.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Install nginx
  yum:
    name: nginx
    state: present
```

**File: `db-tasks.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Install mariadb
  yum:
    name: mariadb-server
    state: present
```

### Method 4: Using Tags for Selectivity

Tags allow you to run specific parts of a large playbook without running everything.

**File: `site.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Web tasks
  hosts: web
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: web  # <--- Assigned Tag

- name: DB tasks
  hosts: db
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install mariadb
      yum:
        name: mariadb-server
        state: present
      tags: db   # <--- Assigned Tag
```

**Execution:** Run ONLY the web parts:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags web
```

### Method 5: Shell Scripts & Chaining

You can create a simple bash script to run multiple playbooks sequentially, or use one-liners.

**Shell Script (`run.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ansible-playbook web.yml
ansible-playbook db.yml
ansible-playbook firewall.yml
```

**One-Liner:**

```bash
ansible-playbook web.yml && ansible-playbook db.yml
```
