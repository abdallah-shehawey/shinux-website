A comprehensive guide to understanding Variables in Ansible and their Precedence order. This file is designed to be a reference from beginner to professional levels.

## 🧠 Introduction: What are Variables? Why use them?

Variables are a way to store values (like usernames, file paths, or package names) and use them throughout your Playbooks.

**Importance:**

1. **Dynamic:** Makes the code flexible (changing a value in one place applies it everywhere).

2. **Reusability:** You can use the same Playbook for different servers just by changing the variables.

## 🏆 Variable Precedence (Who Wins?)

In Ansible, you can define variables in many places. If the same variable is defined in two different places, **who wins?**

The General Rule: **"The most specific wins, and the CLI overrides everything."**

The Order from Strongest (Always Wins) to Weakest:

1. **Extra Vars (`-e`)** (From Command Line - The Strongest 💪).

2. **Task Vars / set_fact** (Inside the task during execution).

3. **Play Vars** (Defined inside the Play).

4. **Host Vars** (Specific to a single server).

5. **Group Vars** (Specific to a group of servers).

6. **Role Defaults** (The Weakest - used only as default values).

## 🚀 Detailed Examples (From Strongest to Weakest)

In the following examples, we assume we want to print a message using the variable `message`.

### 1️⃣ Extra Vars (`-e`)

This method is the **Wildcard**. Any variable you write here will wipe out any old value and replace it. It is usually used during manual execution or in Pipelines (CI/CD).

**Command:**

```
ansible-playbook play.yml -e "message='Hello from CLI'"
```

- **`-e` or `--extra-vars`**: This argument allows you to pass variables at **Runtime**.

- **Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very important for testing and Overriding).

**Playbook:**

```
- name: Example with extra vars
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **Result:** It will print `Hello from CLI` regardless of what is written inside the files.

### 2️⃣ set_fact (Runtime Variables)

This module allows you to create or modify variables **during** the execution of the Playbook.

**Playbook:**

```
- name: Example with set_fact
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set a variable dynamically
      set_fact:
        message: 'Hello from set_fact'

    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **What does it do?** It reserves the variable in the server's (Host) memory during execution.

- **Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very important for calculations or building variables based on previous results).

- **Priority:** Very high, beats Play Vars and Inventory Vars.

### 3️⃣ Vars in a Play

Defining variables explicitly inside the Playbook file itself under the `vars` section.

**Playbook:**

```
- name: Example with vars in play
  hosts: all
  vars:
    message: 'Hello from vars'
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **Advantage:** Clear, easy to read, and exists in the same file.

- **Disadvantage:** Hard to change if you want to use different values for each environment (Prod vs Dev).

### 4️⃣ vars_files

Instead of writing variables inside the Playbook and cluttering it, we place them in an external file and import them.

**File: `vars.yml`**

```
message: 'Hello from vars_files'
```

**Playbook:**

```
- name: Example with vars_files
  hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent for organization, and for keeping secrets in files encrypted with **Ansible Vault**).

### 5️⃣ host_vars

Variables specific to **one single server**. They are placed in a folder named `host_vars` containing a file named after the server or IP.

**Directory Structure:**

```
project/
├── playbook.yml
└── host_vars/
    └── 192.168.1.10.yml  <-- (Contains: message: 'Hello from host_vars')
```

**Playbook:**

```
- name: Example with host_vars
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **When to use?** If you have one server that needs special settings (e.g., a Master Node needs more RAM than Workers).

### 6️⃣ group_vars

Variables specific to a **whole group** of servers (like the `web` or `db` group).

**Directory Structure:**

```bash
project/
├── playbook.yml
└── group_vars/
    ├── all.yml           <-- (Applies to ALL servers)
    └── web.yml           <-- (Applies only to the web group)
```

**Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Example with group_vars
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
```

- **Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (This is the standard place to put general variables).

- **Note:** `host_vars` is stronger than `group_vars`. (Specific beats General).
     
## 🛠️ Must-Know Additions

These commands and concepts are essential for anyone using Ansible.

### 1. `register` (How to store command output?)

The most important way to create dynamic variables. It captures the output of a Linux command and stores it in a variable for later use.

**Example:**

```
- name: Check if file exists
  command: ls /tmp/myfile.txt
  register: file_check
  ignore_errors: true

- name: Print the result
  debug:
    msg: "File exists!"
  when: file_check.rc == 0
```

- **`register: file_check`**: Stores all execution details in a variable named `file_check`.

- **`file_check.rc`**: The Return Code (0 means success).

- **`file_check.stdout`**: The text output of the command.

### 2. Ansible Facts (Automatic Info)

When Ansible starts, it gathers information about the server (IP, OS, RAM, CPU) and stores it in variables called **Facts**.

- You can view them with the command: `ansible all -m setup`

- **Famous Examples:**

  - `ansible_default_ipv4.address`: Main IP address.

  - `ansible_distribution`: OS Distribution (CentOS, Ubuntu).

  - `ansible_memtotal_mb`: Total RAM size.

**Example in Playbook:**

```
- debug:
    msg: "This server is running {{ ansible_distribution }} with IP {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
```

### 3. Magic Variables

Special variables provided by Ansible that give you information about the Inventory.

- **`inventory_hostname`**: The name of the server as written in the Inventory file.

- **`groups`**: A list of all groups and the servers inside them.

- **`group_names`**: A list of group names that the current server belongs to.

### 4. Jinja2 Filters (Formatting Variables)

You can manipulate variable values using **Filters**.

- **`default`**: Set a backup value if the variable doesn't exist.

    ```
    msg: "{{ my_var | default('Not Defined') }}"
    ```

- **`upper`**: Convert text to uppercase.

    ```
    msg: "{{ message | upper }}"
    ```
