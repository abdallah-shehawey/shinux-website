A comprehensive guide to **Ansible Vault**, the built-in feature for keeping sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens) secure. This document covers everything from creating encrypted files to automating decryption.

## 🧠 What is Ansible Vault?

Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt files or individual variables so that they are stored as garbled text (AES-256 encryption) instead of plain text.

- **Problem:** You can't commit passwords to Git in plain text.

- **Solution:** Encrypt them with Vault, and Ansible decrypts them on the fly when running the playbook.

## 🚀 Part 1: Basic Commands (CRUD Operations)

### 1. Create a New Encrypted File

Creates a new file and immediately prompts you for a password to encrypt it.

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

- **Process:**

    1. Prompts for a new Vault password.

    2. Opens your default text editor (vim/nano).

    3. You write your variables (e.g., `db_pass: 12345`).

    4. When you save and exit, the file is saved as encrypted text.

### 2. View an Encrypted File

If you try to `cat` the file, you will see garbage. Use this command to read it.

```bash
ansible-vault view secrets.yml
```

- **Argument:** You will be asked for the vault password to decrypt it temporarily for viewing.

### 3. Edit an Encrypted File

Modifies an existing encrypted file.

```bash
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
```

- **Process:** Ansible decrypts the file in memory, opens the editor, and re-encrypts it immediately when you save.

## 🔧 Part 2: File Management (Encrypting & Decrypting)

### 1. Encrypt an Existing Plaintext File

If you already have a `vars.yml` file and want to secure it.

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt vars.yml
```

- **Result:** The readable file is converted into an encrypted Vault file.

### 2. Decrypt a File (Permanent)

Removes encryption and saves the file as plain text (Dangerous! Use carefully).

```bash
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
```

### 3. Change Password (Rekey)

If you want to change the vault password without decrypting and re-encrypting manually.

```bash
ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml
```

- **Input:** Requires the **Old** password first, then the **New** password.

## 🛠️ Part 3: Using Vault in Playbooks

### 1. The Playbook Structure

You include the encrypted file in `vars_files` just like a normal file. Ansible handles the decryption automatically.

**File: `use-vault.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Use encrypted variables
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml  # The encrypted file
  tasks:
    - name: Show database credentials
      debug:
        msg: "User: {{ db_user }}, Password: {{ db_pass }}"
```

### 2. Running the Playbook

You must provide the password when running the playbook, otherwise, it will fail.

**Option A: Interactive Prompt**

```bash
ansible-playbook use-vault.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

- **`--ask-vault-pass`**: Tells Ansible to ask you for the password at the start.

**Option B: Password File (Automation Friendly)** Instead of typing the password every time, save it in a file.

1. Create a file containing just the password:

    ```bash
    echo "SuperSecret123" > ~/.vault_pass.txt
    ```

2. Run the playbook pointing to that file:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook use-vault.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
    ```

## 🌟 Part 4: Advanced Features (Pro Tips)

### 1. Encrypting Single Variables (Inline Vault)

Sometimes you don't want to encrypt the _whole_ file, just one specific password (like inside `group_vars/all.yml`).

**Command:**

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'SuperSecret123' --name 'db_password'
```

**Output:** It gives you a block of text you can paste directly into your YAML file:

```yaml
db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          36373832656...
```

- **Benefit:** You can read the rest of the file (keys, usernames) normally, while only the sensitive value is hidden.

### 2. Multiple Vault Passwords

Ansible supports using multiple passwords for different environments (e.g., Dev vs Prod).

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-id dev@prompt --vault-id prod@~/.prod_pass
```
