This guide covers Docker Compose from basic concepts to advanced networking and versioning. It explains how to manage multi-container applications easily using a YAML file instead of running complex commands manually.

## 1. The Problem: The "Matrix from Hell"

Before Docker Compose, if you wanted to run a complex application (like the Voting App), you had to run many commands manually and link them together.

### The Hard Way (Manual `docker run`)

Imagine you have an app with a Web Server, Database, Redis, and Ansible. You would have to type this every time:

```bash
# 1. Start the Web App
docker run -d --name simple-webapp mmumshad/simple-webapp

# 2. Start MongoDB
docker run -d --name mongodb mongodb

# 3. Start Redis
docker run -d --name redis redis:alpine

# 4. Start Ansible
docker run -d --name ansible ansible
```

**The Issues:**

1. **Tedious:** You have to remember long commands and flags.

2. **Linking:** Connecting containers manually (`--link`) is messy.

3. **Dependencies:** You must remember to start the Database _before_ the Web App.

## 2. The Solution: `docker-compose.yml`

Docker Compose allows you to write all these configurations into a single file named `docker-compose.yml`.

### Example 1: Simple WebApp

Here is how the commands above translate into a Compose file:

```bash
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'  # Always specify the version

services:     # Define your containers here
  web:
    image: mmumshad/simple-webapp
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  
  database:
    image: mongodb
  
  messaging:
    image: redis:alpine
  
  orchestration:
    image: ansible
```

### How to Run It?

Instead of typing 4 commands, you simply type:

**Command:**

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- **What it does:** It reads the file, pulls the images, creates the network, and starts all containers in the correct order.

## 3. Essential Docker Compose Commands

These are the commands you will use daily.

### Start Everything (`up`)

**Command:** `docker-compose up`

- **Flags:**

  - `-d` (Detached): Runs containers in the background (very important so your terminal doesn't get stuck).

  - `--build`: Forces Docker to rebuild images from Dockerfiles (useful if you changed code).

### Stop Everything (`down`)

**Command:** `docker-compose down`

- **What it does:** Stops containers **AND** removes them. It also removes the created networks.

- **Why use it?** It cleans up your environment completely.

### View Logs (`logs`)

**Command:** `docker-compose logs -f`

- **Flags:**

  - `-f` (Follow): Streams the logs live (like `tail -f`).

### List Containers (`ps`)

**Command:** `docker-compose ps`

- **What it does:** Lists only the containers related to the current `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 4. Real World Scenario: The Voting App

Let's look at the complex example provided in your notes (The "Cats vs Dogs" voting app). This app has 5 components:

1. **Voting-App** (Python): Front-end for users to vote (Cats or Dogs).

2. **Redis** (In-Memory DB): Collects votes temporarily.

3. **Worker** (.NET): Processes votes and moves them to DB.

4. **DB** (Postgres): Persistent database.

5. **Result-App** (NodeJS): Front-end to show results.

### Configuration A: Using Images (The Basic Way)

If all images are already built and pushed to Docker Hub:

```bash
redis:
  image: redis
db:
  image: postgres:9.4
vote:
  image: voting-app
  ports:
    - "5000:80"
  links:             # Deprecated (See Section 6)
    - redis
result:
  image: result
  ports:
    - "5001:80"
  links:
    - db
worker:
  image: worker
  links:
    - redis
    - db
```

### Configuration B: Using `build` (The Developer Way)

Usually, you have the source code on your laptop and want Docker to **build** the image for you.

```bash
redis:
  image: redis
db:
  image: postgres:9.4
vote:
  build: ./vote       # Path to the folder containing Dockerfile
  ports:
    - "5000:80"
result:
  build: ./result     # Path to Result App code
  ports:
    - "5001:80"
worker:
  build: ./worker     # Path to Worker App code
```

**Key Difference:**

- `image: xxx`: Docker pulls it from the internet.

- `build: ./xxx`: Docker runs `docker build -t ...` using the Dockerfile in that folder.

## 5. Evolution of Versions (v1 vs v2 vs v3)

Docker Compose has changed over time.

### Version 1 (Legacy)

- **Structure:** No `version` line. Just lists containers directly.

- **Networking:** Uses the default Bridge. Links (`links:`) are mandatory to enable communication.

- **Status:** **Deprecated**. Do not use.

### Version 2 (Major Change)

- **Structure:** Must start with `version: "2"` and put containers under `services:`.

- **Networking:** Creates a dedicated Bridge Network for the project. **All containers can talk to each other automatically** using their service name (e.g., `ping redis`).

- **Feature (`depends_on`):** Introduced to specify startup order. For example, ensuring Redis starts before the Voting App.

```bash
version: "2"
services:
  redis:
    image: redis
  vote:
    image: voting-app
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    depends_on:    # <--- Start redis first
      - redis
```

### Version 3 (Swarm Compatible)

- **Structure:** Similar to v2 (`version: "3"`).

- **Focus:** Designed for Docker Swarm (Clusters).

- **Changes:** Some options like `mem_limit` moved under `deploy` key.

## 6. Advanced Networking (Front-end vs Back-end)

In a professional setup, you don't want everyone talking to everyone.

- **Front-end:** Accessible by users.

- **Back-end:** Accessible only by internal apps (Database should not be public).

### The Architecture

- **Voting App:** Needs `front-end` (Users vote) AND `back-end` (Sends vote to Redis).

- **Redis:** Needs `back-end` only.

- **Worker:** Needs `back-end` only.

- **DB:** Needs `back-end` only.

- **Result App:** Needs `front-end` (Users see results) AND `back-end` (Reads from DB).

### The Docker Compose File

```bash
version: "2"

services:
  vote:
    image: voting-app
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    networks:
      - front-end
      - back-end

  redis:
    image: redis
    networks:
      - back-end

  worker:
    image: worker
    networks:
      - back-end

  db:
    image: postgres:9.4
    networks:
      - back-end

  result:
    image: result
    ports:
      - "5001:80"
    networks:
      - front-end
      - back-end

# Define the networks here
networks:
  front-end:
  back-end:
```

**Why is this important?**

- **Security:** If a hacker hacks the `vote` app, they cannot easily attack the Database because they are segmented.

- **Organization:** Keeps traffic clean.

## 7. Deprecation Warning: Links

You might see `--link` in old tutorials.

- **Old Way:** `docker run --link redis:redis ...`

- **New Way:** Just use the service name!

  - If you name your service `redis` in `docker-compose.yml`, other containers can simply connect to the host `redis`. Docker handles the DNS.

## Practice

To master this, try deploying the full Voting App yourself. The code is available here: **Link:** [https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app "null")
