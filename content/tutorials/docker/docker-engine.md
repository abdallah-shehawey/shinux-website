This guide takes you "under the hood" of Docker. It explains the architecture of the Docker Engine, how to manage remote engines, and the Linux technologies (Namespaces & Cgroups) that make containerization possible.

## 1. What is Docker Engine?

Docker Engine is not just a single program; it is a modular client-server application with three major components:

1. **Docker CLI (Client):**

    - This is the command line tool you use (`docker run`, `docker build`).

    - It does **not** do the actual work. It just sends instructions.

2. **REST API:**

    - The interface (Translator) that allows the Client and Daemon to talk.

    - It follows standard HTTP patterns.

3. **Docker Daemon (Server):**

    - The background process (`dockerd`) running on the host.

    - This is the "Brain". It listens for API requests and manages images, containers, networks, and volumes.

### Visual Flow

`User (CLI) --> REST API --> Docker Daemon (Host)`

## 2. Remote Docker Engine Management

By default, your Docker CLI talks to the Docker Daemon on the **same machine** (Localhost) via a Unix Socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`).

However, you can configure your Laptop's CLI to talk to a **Remote Server's Daemon**.

### Command: Connect to Remote Engine

```bash
docker -H=remote-docker-engine:2375 run nginx
```

**OR (using IP):**

```bash
docker -H=10.123.2.1:2375 run nginx
```

### Detailed Argument Breakdown

- `-H` (or `--host`): **Critical Argument.**

  - It tells the CLI: "Don't talk to the local daemon. Talk to _this_ specific socket or address."

  - Format: `tcp://<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>`

- `:2375`: This is the default unencrypted port for the Docker Daemon API.

  - _Security Note:_ In production, you should use port `2376` (TLS Encrypted) to prevent hackers from hijacking your engine.

**Use Case:** You are sitting in a cafe with your lightweight laptop (CLI only), but you are running heavy containers on a massive server in the cloud using the `-H` flag.

## 3. Under the Hood: Containerization

How does Docker isolate containers? It uses native **Linux Kernel** features. It doesn't use magic; it uses **Namespaces**.

### A. Namespaces (Isolation)

Namespaces trick the process into thinking it has its own dedicated computer. It limits what a process can **SEE**.

1. **PID Namespace (Process ID):**

    - Isolates processes. A process inside the container thinks it is PID 1 (The Boss), but outside it is just a normal child process (e.g., PID 4500).

2. **Network Namespace:**

    - Gives the container its own IP address, routing table, and localhost, separate from the host.

3. **Mount Namespace:**

    - Gives the container its own File System. It cannot see the Host's files unless explicitly mounted.

4. **IPC Namespace (InterProcess Communication):**

    - Prevents processes in one container from reading memory of processes in another container.

5. **UTS Namespace:**

    - Allows the container to have its own Hostname.

### B. The PID Matrix (Host vs Container)

This is a classic interview concept.

**Inside the Container (Child System):**

- `nginx` thinks it is **PID 1**.

- It sees only itself.

**On the Linux Host (Parent System):**

- The `nginx` process is actually visible as **PID 3456** (for example).

- It is just a child process of the Docker Daemon.

## 4. Resource Management: Control Groups (cgroups)

If Namespaces limit what a container can **SEE**, Control Groups (cgroups) limit what a container can **USE**.

Without cgroups, a single container could consume 100% of your CPU and crash your server.

### A. Limiting CPU

**Command:**

```bash
docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu
```

- **Flag:** `--cpus`

- **Value:** `.5` means "50% of **ONE** CPU core".

- **Importance:** Ensures this container never slows down other critical applications by eating all processing power.

### B. Limiting Memory (RAM)

**Command:**

```bash
docker run --memory=100m ubuntu
```
