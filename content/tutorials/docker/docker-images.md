This document is designed to be the only reference you will ever need for **Docker Images**. It covers concepts, creation, building, management, and advanced distribution techniques in extreme detail.

## What is a Docker Image?

### The Concept

Think of a Docker Image as a **frozen snapshot** of an application. It contains everything the app needs to run:

- The Code.

- The Runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).

- System Tools & Libraries.

- Settings & Configurations.

### Image vs. Container

- **Image:** The **Class** (in programming). It is read-only. You cannot change it once built.

- **Container:** The **Object** (Instance). It is the running version of the image. You can write data to it.

> **Analogy:**
>
> - **Image:** A recipe for a cake.
>
> - **Container:** The actual cake you baked. You can eat the cake, but eating it doesn't change the recipe on the paper.

## The `dockerfile`: Writing the Recipe

A `Dockerfile` is a text file (no extension) containing instructions. Docker reads this file top-to-bottom to build the image.

### Core Instructions (the Building Blocks)

#### `from` (the Foundation)

**Command:** `FROM <image>:<tag>`

- **Description:** Defines the starting point. Every Dockerfile starts here.

- **Example:** `FROM python:3.9-slim`

- **Why specific tags?** Using `slim` or `alpine` reduces the image size significantly. Avoid using `latest` in production to prevent unexpected updates.

#### `workdir` (the Navigation)

**Command:** `WORKDIR /path/to/dir`

- **Description:** Sets the "current directory" inside the image.

- **Behavior:** If the directory doesn't exist, Docker creates it.

- **Importance:** It keeps your file system organized. It's better than running `RUN cd /app`.

#### `copy` vs `add` (getting Files In)

1. **`COPY <src> <dest>`**

    - **Description:** Copies files from your computer to the image.

    - **Example:** `COPY . .` (Copy all files from current folder on PC to current folder in image).

    - **Recommendation:** Use this 99% of the time.

2. **`ADD <src> <dest>`**

    - **Description:** Like COPY, but has superpowers:

        - Can download files from a URL.

        - Can unzip `.tar.gz` files automatically.

    - **Recommendation:** Use only if you specifically need these features.

#### `run` (the Builder)

**Command:** `RUN <linux_command>`

- **Description:** Runs a command **during the build process**.

- **Use Cases:** Installing libraries, updating OS, setting permissions.

- **Example:** `RUN pip install flask`

- **Note:** Each `RUN` command creates a permanent layer in the image.

#### `env` (the Configuration)

**Command:** `ENV KEY=VALUE`

- **Description:** Sets environment variables that persist when the container runs.

- **Example:** `ENV APP_ENV=production`

#### `expose` (the Documentation)

**Command:** `EXPOSE <port>`

- **Description:** A note to the developer that this app _listens_ on a specific port.

- **Important:** It does **NOT** publish the port. You still need `-p` when running `docker run`.

#### `user` (the Security)

**Command:** `USER <username>`

- **Description:** Switches to a non-root user for security.

- **Example:** `USER appuser`

## `cmd` vs `entrypoint` (the Startup Logic)

Both tell the container what to do when it starts. The difference is how they handle arguments.

### `cmd` (the Default)

- **Purpose:** Provides defaults.

- **Behavior:** Easily overridden.

- **Example:** `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`

  - `docker run myapp` -> Runs `python app.py`.

  - `docker run myapp echo hello` -> Runs `echo hello` (Ignores Python).

### `entrypoint` (the Executable)

- **Purpose:** Makes the container run like a binary executable.

- **Behavior:** Hard to override. Arguments are **appended**.

- **Example:** `ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]`

  - `docker run myapp Hello` -> Runs `echo Hello`.

### The Best Practice (combine Them)

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

- If you run `docker run myapp`, it executes: `python app.py --help`.

- If you run `docker run myapp --version`, it executes: `python app.py --version`.

## Building Images: `docker Build`

The command that turns your Dockerfile into an image.

**Command:**

```text
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
```

### Important Arguments Breakdown

| Argument      | Full Name | Explanation                                                                                        | Is it Important? |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `-t`          | `--tag`   | Names the image (`name:tag`). If skipped, you get a random ID.                                     | **Critical**     |
| `.`           | Context   | Tells Docker where to find files for `COPY`. It means "Current Directory".                         | **Critical**     |
| `-f`          | `--file`  | Points to a specific Dockerfile name (e.g., `-f Dockerfile.dev`).                                  | Useful           |
| `--no-cache`  |           | Forces Docker to rebuild all layers from scratch. Useful if `apt-get update` is stuck on old data. | Advanced         |
| `--build-arg` |           | Passes variables meant only for the build phase (not runtime).                                     | Advanced         |

## Managing Images on Your Machine

### Listing Images

**Command:** `docker images`

- **Details:** Shows Repository, Tag, Image ID, Created Date, Size.

- **Argument:** `docker images -a` (Show all, including intermediate layers).

- **Argument:** `docker images -q` (Quiet: returns only IDs).

### Removing Images

**Command:** `docker rmi <image_id_or_name>`

- **Argument:** `-f` (Force): Deletes the image even if it's tagged multiple times or if a stopped container is using it.

  - _Warning:_ Don't use `-f` unless you are sure.

### Cleaning Up (pruning)

Over time, your disk fills up with "Dangling Images" (Images with no name `<none>:<none>`). **Command:** `docker image prune`

- **Action:** Deletes only dangling images.

- **Argument:** `-a` (All): Deletes **ALL** images not currently used by any running container. (Powerful cleanup).

### Inspecting Image Details

**Command:** `docker inspect <image_name>`

- **Output:** A JSON object.

- **Why use it?** To see the default environment variables, the entrypoint, the OS architecture, and layers.

### Viewing Image History

**Command:** `docker history <image_name>`

- **Output:** Shows the layers of the image.

- **Why use it?** To find out which command (`RUN`, `COPY`) made the image size so big.

## Image Distribution (sharing)

### Method A: Docker Hub (online Registry)

1. **Login:**

    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2. **Tagging:** You must rename the image to include your Docker Hub username.

    ```bash
    docker tag myapp:v1 username/myapp:v1
    ```

3. **Pushing:**

    ```bash
    docker push username/myapp:v1
    ```

### Method B: Offline Transfer (tarball)

This is crucial for "Air-gapped" systems (servers with no internet).

1. **Save (Export):** Pack the image into a `.tar` file.

    ```bash
    docker save -o myapp.tar myapp:v1
    ```

    - `-o`: Output file path.

2. **Transfer:** Copy `myapp.tar` to the other machine via USB or SCP.

3. **Load (Import):** Load the image into Docker on the new machine.

    ```bash
    docker load -i myapp.tar
    ```

    - `-i`: Input file path.

## Advanced Concept: Layers & Caching

### How Layers Work

Docker images are built like a sandwich. Each instruction (`RUN`, `COPY`) adds a new layer on top of the previous one.

- **Read-Only:** All image layers are read-only.

- **The Container Layer:** When you run a container, Docker adds a thin "Read/Write" layer on top.

### Docker Build Cache (the Speed Secret)

Docker remembers the result of every line in your Dockerfile.

1. If you change line 5, Docker reuses the layers for lines 1-4 (Instant).

2. It rebuilds line 5 and **everything after it**.

**Optimization Tip:** Put things that change often (like your Source Code) at the **bottom** of the Dockerfile. Put things that rarely change (like `pip install requirements`) at the **top**.

**Bad Example:**

```dockerfile
COPY . .              # <--- Source code changes often
RUN pip install flask # <--- This will re-run every time code changes! (Slow)
```

**Good Example:**

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install flask # <--- Cached! Won't run unless requirements change.
COPY . .              # <--- Only this runs when code changes. (Fast)
```

## Full Real-world Example (line-by-line Explanation)

Let's imagine we are building a Python Web App using Flask.

### The App Code (`app.py`)

This is the simple program we want to run.

```ini
# app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from Docker!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### The Dockerfile

This is the recipe we write to containerize the app above.

```text
# 1. Base Image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# 2. Working Directory
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install flask

# 4. Source Code
COPY . .

# 5. Documentation
EXPOSE 5000

# 6. Startup Command
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Explanation of the Code (what Each Line Does)

1. **`FROM python:3.9-slim`**:

    - **What it does:** Tells Docker to download a pre-built OS that already has Python 3.9 installed.

    - **Why `slim`?** It's a lightweight version (smaller download size) compared to the full Python image.

2. **`WORKDIR /app`**:

    - **What it does:** Creates a folder named `/app` inside the image and moves the "cursor" there.

    - **Why?** So we don't dump our files in the root folder (`/`). It keeps things organized.

3. **`COPY requirements.txt .`**:

    - **What it does:** Copies only the requirements file from your computer to the `/app` folder inside the image.

    - **Why?** We copy this _before_ the rest of the code to use Docker Caching (as explained in Section 7).

4. **`RUN pip install flask`**:

    - **What it does:** Runs the command to download the Flask library from the internet _inside_ the image.

    - **Result:** The image now has Python AND Flask installed.

5. **`COPY . .`**:

    - **What it does:** Copies all your other files (like `app.py`) from your computer to the image.

    - **Why now?** Because source code changes often. If we change the code, Docker only rebuilds from this line onwards.

6. **`EXPOSE 5000`**:

    - **What it does:** Documentation only. It tells the user "Hey, this app runs on port 5000".

    - **Note:** You still need to use `-p 5000:5000` when running the container.

7. **`CMD ["python", "app.py"]`**:

    - **What it does:** This is the final instruction. It tells the container: "When you start up, run this command automatically".

    - **Result:** The web server starts listening for requests.
