A simplified guide to understanding how Git works, how to install it, and how to start tracking your projects.

## Core Concepts

When working with Git, your files go through a specific journey. Here is an explanation of the terms you mentioned in a structured technical way:

### Working Directory

When you start a new project and initialize Git, this folder is called the **Working Directory**. At this stage, Git sees the files but doesn't take any action on them (they are in an `untracked` state) unless you explicitly tell it to.

### Snapshot

In Git, we don't just save random full copies of the folder. Instead, we take **Snapshots**.

- **The Snapshot:** This is a record of the state of all project files at a specific point in time.

- Instead of saving the entire file every time, Git is smart enough to save only the **new changes** in every snapshot. This makes Git fast and space-efficient.

### Commit

A **Commit** is the actual process of saving a snapshot into your project's history.

> **Simple Analogy:** Imagine you are playing a video game and you reach a certain level and "Save" your progress. That "Save" is exactly what a **Commit** is in the world of programming.

## Installing Git

### Step 1: Download

You can download Git for any Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux) from the official website: 🔗 [Click here to download Git](https://git-scm.com/install/ "null")

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After downloading and installing, open your Terminal or Command Prompt and type the following command to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
git --version
```

## The Git Lifecycle

1. **Modify:** You edit your files in the _Working Directory_.

2. **Stage:** You select the specific changes you want to include in the next snapshot (using `git add`).

3. **Commit:** You permanently save the snapshot to the Git database (using `git commit`).
