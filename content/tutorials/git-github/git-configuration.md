This guide covers everything from installation and basic concepts to managing your user configuration at different levels.

## Installation & Setup

### Download Git

You can download Git for any Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux) from the official website: 🔗 [git-scm.com/install](https://git-scm.com/install/ "null")

### Verify Installation

After installing, open your Terminal or Command Prompt and run the following command to ensure Git is ready:

```bash
git --version
```

## User Configuration

Git requires an identity (email and username) to be attached to every **Commit** you make. You can set this at two different levels:

### Global Configuration (system-wide)

This sets a default identity for **all projects** on your computer.

```bash
git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "username"
```

### Local Configuration (repository Level)

Use this if you want to use a different identity for a **specific repository** (e.g., using a work email for a specific folder). _Note: You must run these commands inside that specific project folder._

```bash
git config --local user.email "example@gmail.com"
git config --local user.name "username"
```

### Check Your Settings

To verify your current configuration, use:

```bash
# To see all settings
git config --list

# To see a specific setting
git config user.email
```

## Core Concepts

### Working Directory

When you start a project with Git, your folder is called the **Working Directory**. At this point, Git is aware of the files but hasn't "saved" them into its history yet.

### Snapshots & Commits

- **Snapshot:** Instead of saving a full copy of your project every time, Git takes a "Snapshot" of your files. It only saves the **new changes** made in every file across all snapshots, making it very efficient.

- **Commit:** When you want to save a snapshot of your work, it is called a **Commit**. This acts as a permanent record in your project's history.
