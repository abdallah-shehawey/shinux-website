## What is Git?

Git is a **free and open-source, distributed version control system (VCS)** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- **Distributed:** Unlike older systems, every developer has a full copy of the project history on their local machine, not just a snapshot of the latest code.

## Key Advantages

Git provides two primary benefits that are essential for any development workflow:

1. **Version Control:** * It allows you to save "snapshots" of your project at different stages. If a new update breaks your code, you can easily roll back to a previous working version.

2. **Tracing Changes:**

    - Git keeps a detailed log of every change made to the files. You can see exactly what was changed, when it happened, and why (through commit messages).

## The "local" Limitation

While Git is powerful, it has one significant drawback when used in isolation:

- **Local Scope:** By default, Git is a **local tool**. All the versioning and tracing happen on your own computer.

- **The Collaboration Gap:** If you are working in a team, others cannot see your changes, your code, or your history unless you use a "Remote" hosting service (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to share your local repository.
