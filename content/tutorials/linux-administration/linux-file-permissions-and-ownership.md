## Introduction

Linux is a **multi-user system**, and file permissions are the backbone of its security model. Every file and directory is protected by ownership rules that determine **who can read, write, or execute** it.

This guide explains permissions from **kernel perspective to admin practice**.

---

## File Permission Model

Linux permissions are based on **three subjects** and **three actions**.

### Subjects

|Subject|Symbol|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Owner|`u`|User who owns the file|
|Group|`g`|Group owning the file|
|Others|`o`|Everyone else|

### Permissions

|Permission|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Read|`r` (4)|View contents|
|Write|`w` (2)|Modify|
|Execute|`x` (1)|Run / access|

---

## Understanding `ls -l`

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice developers 4096 file.txt
```

|Field|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`-`|File type|
|`rw-`|Owner|
|`r--`|Group|
|`r--`|Others|
|`alice`|Owner|
|`developers`|Group|

---

## Permission Bits Explained

|Numeric|Binary|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|7|111|rwx|
|6|110|rw-|
|5|101|r-x|
|4|100|r--|

Example:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

---

## chmod — Change Permissions

### Symbolic Mode

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh
chmod g-w file.txt
chmod o-r secret.txt
```

### Numeric Mode

```bash
chmod 640 file.txt
```

---

## chown — Change Ownership

```bash
sudo chown alice file.txt
sudo chown alice:developers file.txt
sudo chown -R alice /projects
```

---

## chgrp — Change Group

```bash
sudo chgrp developers project.txt
sudo chgrp -R admins /srv
```

---

## Directory Permissions (Critical)

|Permission|Effect on Directory|
|---|---|
|`r`|List names|
|`w`|Create/delete files|
|`x`|Access directory|

✅ Without `x`, you cannot access files even if readable.

---

## setuid, setgid, sticky bit

### setuid

```bash
chmod u+s program
```

Program runs as file owner (e.g. passwd).

### setgid

```bash
chmod g+s directory
```

New files inherit group.

### Sticky Bit

```bash
chmod +t /tmp
```

Prevents deleting others’ files.

---

## umask

Controls default permissions.

```bash
umask
umask 022
```

---

## Permission Resolution Order

1. Owner
    
2. Group
    
3. Others
    

The kernel stops at the first match.

---

## Common Permission Mistakes

- Forgetting execute bit on directories
    
- Overusing `777`
    
- Ignoring group strategy
    

---

## Summary

- Linux permissions are kernel enforced
    
- Numeric and symbolic modes exist
    
- Directories behave differently
    
- Special bits enable enterprise sharing
