This documentation covers essential concepts and commands for the Linux Networking Command Line Interface, specifically tailored for machine routing and embedded systems context.

## 1. Listing Network Interfaces

To view all network interfaces on the system, including those that are currently "down" (inactive), you can use two main approaches: the legacy `net-tools` or the modern `iproute2` suite.

### Method A: Using `ifconfig` (Legacy)

> **Note:** `ifconfig` is part of the `net-tools` package. While widely used, it is technically deprecated in some modern distributions in favor of the `ip` command.

**Command:**

```bash
ifconfig -a
```

**Output Explanation:** Below is a breakdown of the output fields using the provided example:

```bash
enp52s0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether e8:80:88:29:6a:93  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

- **Interface Name (`enp52s0`):** Represents the physical Ethernet port.
    
- **Flags `<UP...>`:** The interface is enabled logically, but `RUNNING` is missing, indicating no cable is plugged in.
    
- **ether:** The MAC Address (Physical address) of the card.
    
- **RX/TX:** Receive/Transmit statistics. Here they are 0, confirming no traffic.
    

```bash
lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 152  bytes 14709 (14.7 KB)
        ...
```

- **lo (Loopback):** The internal virtual interface used for localhost communication.

- **inet 127.0.0.1:** The standard localhost IPv4 address.

- **MTU 65536:** Loopback supports huge packet sizes because traffic stays in memory.


```bash
wlp0s20f3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.165.26.87  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.165.26.255
        inet6 fe80::7cf3:464:1386:165c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 30:89:4a:c2:74:1e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 95989  bytes 101998303 (101.9 MB)
        ...
```

- **wlp... (Wireless):** The Wi-Fi interface.
    
- **flags `<...RUNNING...>`:** Indicates the interface is active and connected to a network.
    
- **inet 10.165.26.87:** The IPv4 address assigned to this machine.
    
- **RX/TX packets:** Shows actual data traffic (101.9 MB received, 11.3 MB sent).
    

### Method B: Using `ip link` (Modern Standard)

> **Note:** This is the preferred method in modern Linux systems (Yocto/Embedded Linux often relies heavily on `iproute2`).

**Command:**

```bash
ip link show
```

**Output Explanation:**

```bash
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

- **state UNKNOWN:** Normal for loopback interfaces (it doesn't need a physical carrier).
    
- **qdisc noqueue:** No queuing discipline needed (instant traffic).
    

```bash
2: enp52s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e8:80:88:29:6a:93 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

- **NO-CARRIER:** Confirms physical disconnection (cable unplugged).
    
- **state DOWN:** The interface is administratively UP (enabled in OS), but physically DOWN.
    
- **qdisc fq_codel:** Fair Queuing Controlled Delay (modern algorithm to prevent buffer bloat).
    

```bash
3: wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 30:89:4a:c2:74:1e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

- **state UP:** The interface is fully operational and connected.
    
- **LOWER_UP:** Physical layer (L1) is active.
    

### Summary Comparison: `ifconfig` vs `ip link show`

|Feature|`ifconfig`|`ip link show`|
|---|---|---|
|**Package Suite**|`net-tools`|`iproute2`|
|**Status**|**Deprecated** (Legacy)|**Current Standard**|
|**OS Availability**|May be missing in minimal Yocto images|Default in almost all modern Linux distros|
|**Information Scope**|Shows **IP addresses (L3)** and **MAC (L2)** together|Shows **only Link/MAC (L2)** details|
|**Detail Level**|Verbose, human-readable|Concise, precise, script-friendly|
|**Secondary IPs**|Does not reliably show multiple IPs per interface|Handles multiple addresses/aliases natively|

## 2. Interface Configuration & Management

This section covers how to manipulate the state of interfaces and assign addresses.

### 2.1 Enabling/Disabling Interfaces

**Purpose:** Activate (bring up) or deactivate (take down) a specific network interface to allow or stop traffic.

**Using `ip` (Modern):**

```bash
# Bring interface UP
sudo ip link set dev <interface> up

# Bring interface DOWN
sudo ip link set dev <interface> down
```

- `set`: The action to modify the device.
    
- `dev <interface>`: Target device (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
    
- `up/down`: The desired state.
    

**Using `ifconfig` (Legacy):**

```bash
sudo ifconfig <interface> up
sudo ifconfig <interface> down
```

### 2.2 Configuring IP Addresses

**Purpose:** Assign static IP addresses to network interfaces. This is common in server/embedded environments where DHCP is not used.

**Using `ip` (Modern):**

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev <interface>
sudo ip link set <interface> up
```

- `addr add`: Command to append an address.
    
- `192.168.1.100/24`: **CIDR Notation**. This is crucial.
    
    - `192.168.1.100` is the IP.
        
    - `/24` represents the **Subnet Mask** (`255.255.255.0`).
        
- _Note:_ If you make a mistake, use `del` instead of `add` to remove it.
    

**Using `ifconfig` (Legacy):**

```bash
sudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

- `netmask`: explicitly defines the mask (older style compared to CIDR).
    
- `up`: Can be combined in one line to activate the interface immediately.
    

> **Important:** These changes are **temporary**. They will be lost after a reboot. For persistent configuration in Yocto/Linux, you would edit files like `/etc/network/interfaces` or use `systemd-networkd` / `NetworkManager`.

## 3. Hostname and DNS Configuration

Setting the identity of the machine and how it finds other machines.

### 3.1 Managing Hostnames

**Purpose:** Set or change the system’s name.

- **Temporary (Current Session only):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo hostname <newhostname>
    ```
    
- **Persistent (Permanent across reboots):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>
    ```
    
    - `hostnamectl`: The systemd utility to query and change the system hostname and related settings.
        

### 3.2 Editing the Hosts File

**File Location:** `/etc/hosts`

**Purpose:** Local DNS resolution. The system checks this file _before_ asking a DNS server. It maps hostnames directly to IP addresses.

**Example Entry:**

```bash
127.0.0.1      localhost
192.168.1.10   myserver.local  myserver
```

- If you ping `myserver`, the system immediately knows it is `192.168.1.10` without needing network lookups.
    

### 3.3 DNS Setup

**File Location:** `/etc/resolv.conf`

**Purpose:** Defines the Nameservers (DNS servers) the system uses to resolve domain names (like `google.com`) to IPs.

**Example Content:**

```bash
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```

> **Warning:** In modern systems (Ubuntu, Yocto with systemd), `/etc/resolv.conf` is often a symlink managed by `systemd-resolved` or `NetworkManager`. Editing it manually might work temporarily, but changes could be overwritten by the OS.

## 4. Testing Connectivity

### 4.1 Ping Command

**Purpose:** Test connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests to a target.

**Command:**

```bash
ping <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- Sends packets and reports round-trip time (RTT).
    
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the command.
    
- Options like `-c <count>` can limit the number of pings (e.g., `ping -c 4 google.com`).
    

### 4.2 Traceroute

**Purpose:** Determine the route packets take to reach a network host.

**Command:**

```bash
traceroute <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- Displays each hop along the path.
    
- Options like `-m <max hops>` can set the maximum number of hops (e.g., `traceroute -m 15 google.com`).
    

### 4.3 MTR

**Purpose:** Combine the functionalities of `ping` and `traceroute` for real-time network path analysis.

**Command:**

```bash
mtr <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation:** Provides a continuously updated view of the route and latency at each hop. Options allow changing the reporting interval and packet size.

## 5. Analyzing Network Details

### 5.1 Netstat

**Purpose:** Display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and more.

**Command:**

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- `-t`: Lists TCP connections.
    
- `-u`: Lists UDP connections.
    
- `-l`: Shows only listening sockets.
    
- `-p`: Displays the process using the socket.
    
- `-n`: Uses numeric addresses instead of resolving hostnames.
    

### 5.2 ss Command

**Purpose:** Modern alternative to `netstat` for displaying socket statistics.

**Command:**

```bash
ss -tulpn
```

**Explanation:** Uses similar options to netstat with improved performance and additional filtering capabilities.

### 5.3 IP Route

**Purpose:** View and manage routing tables.

**Command:**

```bash
ip route show
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- `ip route`: Manages routes in the kernel.
    
- `show`: Lists all current routes.
    
- **Adding a route:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ip route add <destination> via <gateway> dev <interface>
    ```
    
    This command explains how packets to `<destination>` are routed through a specified `<gateway>` on the given `<interface>`.
    

## 6. Network Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

### 6.1 tcpdump

**Purpose:** Capture and analyze network packets in real time.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i <interface>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- `-i <interface>`: Specifies which interface to capture packets from.
    
- `-w <file>`: Write the output to a file (e.g., `-w capture.pcap`).
    
- Filter expressions can narrow the capture (e.g., `tcpdump -i <interface> port 80`).
    

### 6.2 nmap

**Purpose:** Network exploration and security auditing.

**Command:**

```bash
nmap <target-ip or hostname>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- `-F`: Quick scan of the most common ports.
    
- `-p <port-range>`: Specify ports to scan (e.g., `-p 1-65535`).
    
- `-O`: Attempt to detect the operating system of the target (requires sudo for some scans).
    

### 6.3 ethtool

**Purpose:** Query and control network device settings.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo ethtool <interface>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- Displays detailed information such as speed, duplex, and auto-negotiation settings.
    
- **To change settings:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ethtool -s <interface> speed 100 duplex full autoneg off
    ```
    
    This command sets the interface to 100Mb/s full duplex with auto-negotiation disabled.
    

### 6.4 Wireless (iw)

**Purpose:** Manage and troubleshoot wireless interfaces.

**Commands:**

- **List wireless devices:**
    
    ```
    iw dev
    ```
    
- **Display connection status:**
    
    ```bash
    iw <interface> link
    ```
    
- **Scan for networks:**
    
    ```
    iw <interface> scan
    ```
    

**Explanation:** The `iw` suite provides detailed control over wireless settings, replacing the older `iwconfig` tool.

## 7. Accessing Network Services

### 7.1 SSH

**Purpose:** Securely access remote machines.

**Command:**

```bash
ssh username@server-ip
```

**Explanation & Options:**

- Establishes an encrypted connection to a remote host.
    
- Options can include specifying a port (`-p <port>`), using key authentication (`-i <keyfile>`), and more.
    

### 7.2 FTP and SFTP

**Purpose:** Transfer files between systems.

- **FTP Command:**
    
    ```bash
    ftp <server-ip>
    ```
    
    Connects to an FTP server. Commands like `put` and `get` manage file transfers.
    
- **SFTP Command:**
    
    ```bash
    sftp username@server-ip
    ```
    
    Secure version running over SSH. It offers similar file operations as FTP but with encryption.
    

### 7.3 Telnet

**Purpose:** Test connectivity to a port (not recommended for secure operations).

**Command:**

```bash
telnet <server-ip> <port>
```

**Explanation:** Connects to the specified port on the remote server, useful for basic connectivity tests.

### 7.4 Web Tools: curl and wget

**Purpose:** Retrieve data from web servers or perform HTTP/S operations.

- **curl:**
    
    ```bash
    curl -I [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)
    ```
    
    - `-I`: Fetches only the HTTP headers.
        
    - Can also be used for POST, PUT, and other HTTP methods.
        
- **wget:**
    
    ```bash
    wget [https://www.example.com/file.tar.gz](https://www.example.com/file.tar.gz)
    ```
    
    - Downloads files from the specified URL. Supports options for recursion, limiting download speed, and more.
        

## 8. Firewall and Security Tools

### 8.1 iptables/nftables

**Purpose:** Manage packet filtering and NAT rules.

- **iptables Example:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -L -n -v
    ```
    
    - `-L`: List all rules.
        
    - `-n`: Display numerical addresses.
        
    - `-v`: Verbose output.
        
- **nftables Example:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo nft list ruleset
    ```
    
    Displays all rules currently active under nftables, the modern replacement for iptables.
    

### 8.2 ufw and firewalld

**Purpose:** Simplify firewall management.

- **ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```
    
    Provides a simplified interface to configure iptables rules, ideal for users seeking ease of use.
    
- **firewalld:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```
    
    Used on many Red Hat-based systems to manage dynamic firewall rules with zones.
    

## 9. Key Configuration Files

Understanding where configuration changes persist is vital:

- **`/etc/hostname`** – Contains the system’s hostname.
    
- **`/etc/hosts`** – Maps hostnames to IP addresses.
    
- **`/etc/resolv.conf`** – Specifies DNS server addresses.
    
- **`/etc/network/interfaces`** or **`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*`** – Contains interface configuration for various distros.
    
- **`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`** – SSH daemon configuration.
    
- **`/etc/services`** – Lists service names and their associated ports.
    

## 10. Mapping Commands to Network Layers (OSI)

Understanding where each command operates helps in diagnostics.

|OSI Layer|Layer Name|Common Devices/Concepts|Tools & Commands|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Layer 1**|**Physical**|Cables, Cards, Link Speed|`ethtool`, `ip link` (state UP/DOWN)|
|**Layer 2**|**Data Link**|MAC Addresses, VLANs, ARP|`ip link`, `ip neigh`, `arp`|
|**Layer 3**|**Network**|IP Addresses, Routing, ICMP|`ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, `traceroute`|
|**Layer 4**|**Transport**|TCP/UDP Ports, Sockets|`netstat`, `ss`, `nmap`|
|**Layer 7**|**Application**|HTTP, FTP, SSH|`curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, `telnet`|

## 11. Logical Troubleshooting Workflow

If the network is down, follow this bottom-up approach:

1. **Physical Check (L1):** Is the cable plugged in? Is the interface UP?
    
    - _Command:_ `ip link show` (Look for `LOWER_UP`)
        
    - _Fix:_ `ip link set dev eth0 up`
        
2. **Link/Local Check (L2):** Do you have a MAC address? Can you see neighbors?
    
    - _Command:_ `ip neigh` (Are neighbors STALE or REACHABLE?)
        
3. **IP Configuration (L3):** Do you have an IP address?
    
    - _Command:_ `ip addr show`
        
    - _Fix:_ Check DHCP or assign static IP.
        
4. **Gateway/Routing (L3):** Can you reach the router?
    
    - _Command:_ `ip route show` (Check for `default via ...`)
        
    - _Test:_ `ping <gateway_ip>`
        
5. **External Connectivity (L3):** Can you reach the internet?
    
    - _Test:_ `ping 8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
        
6. **DNS Resolution (L7):** Can you resolve names?
    
    - _Test:_ `ping google.com`
        
    - _Fix:_ Check `/etc/resolv.conf`
        

## 12. Yocto & Embedded Specifics

In Embedded Linux (Yocto), networking is slightly different than Desktop Linux.

1. **Persistence:** The `ip` commands above are **temporary**. They reset on reboot.
    
2. **Network Managers:** Yocto images typically use one of the following to manage network permanently:
    
    - **systemd-networkd:** (Modern, common) Configured in `/etc/systemd/network/*.network`.
        
    - **ConnMan:** (Common in mobile/IoT) specialized for embedded.
        
    - **ifupdown:** (Legacy) uses `/etc/network/interfaces`.
        

**Example: Persistent Static IP in `systemd-networkd`** Create a file `/etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network`:

```bash
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.10/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=8.8.8.8
```

## 13. Additional Tools and Best Practices

### 13.1 speedtest-cli

**Purpose:** Measure internet bandwidth using speedtest.net.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo apt install speedtest-cli  # For Debian/Ubuntu
speedtest-cli
```

**Explanation:** Run tests to determine your current download and upload speeds.

### 13.2 Additional Tips

- **Automation:** Consider automating common tasks with shell scripts or configuration management tools like Ansible.
    
- **Documentation:** Always consult the man pages (e.g., `man ip`, `man tcpdump`) for in-depth command options.
    
- **Testing:** Experiment in a lab environment before deploying changes to production networks.
