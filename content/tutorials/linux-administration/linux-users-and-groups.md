A **production-grade, systems-level guide** to Linux **users, groups, and identity management**.  
This document does not repeat basic commands only—it explains **how Linux models identities internally**, how permissions are enforced, how administrators design group strategies, and how everything ties into security, filesystems, and enterprise setups.

## 1️⃣ Why Users & Groups Exist

Linux is designed as a **multi-user, time-sharing operating system**.

Goals:

- Isolate users from each other
    
- Prevent accidental or malicious damage
    
- Enable controlled collaboration
    

Everything in Linux runs **as a user**, even system services.

---

## 2️⃣ Identity Model in Linux

### Core Identifiers

|Identifier|Meaning|
|---|---|
|UID|User ID|
|GID|Group ID|
|EUID|Effective User ID|
|EGID|Effective Group ID|

Example:

```bash
id
```

UIDs are what the **kernel actually checks**, not usernames.

---

## 3️⃣ System vs Normal Users

|Type|UID Range|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|root|0|Superuser|
|System users|1–999|Daemons & services|
|Normal users|≥1000|Human users|

System users **cannot usually log in**.

---

## 4️⃣ Where Linux Stores User Data

### Key Files

|File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`/etc/passwd`|User account database|
|`/etc/shadow`|Encrypted passwords|
|`/etc/group`|Group memberships|
|`/etc/gshadow`|Secure group data|

Never edit `/etc/shadow` manually.

---

## 5️⃣ Authentication vs Authorization

|Phase|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Authentication|Who are you?|
|Authorization|What are you allowed to do?|

Linux users & groups control **authorization**, not authentication mechanisms.

---

## 6️⃣ User Management (Deep Dive)

### Creating Users (Low-Level)

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash alice
```

Key options:

- `-u` → UID
    
- `-g` → primary group
    
- `-G` → supplementary groups
    
- `-d` → home directory
    

Passwords:

```bash
sudo passwd alice
```

---

### Modifying Users

```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh alice
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice
```

⚠️ `-G` replaces existing groups — always use `-aG`.

---

### Deleting Users Safely

```bash
sudo userdel alice
sudo userdel -r alice
```

Check for remaining files:

```bash
find / -uid 1001
```

---

## 7️⃣ Group Management (Deep Dive)

### Creating Groups

```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

### Modifying Groups

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a alice developers
sudo gpasswd -d alice developers
```

Groups enable **permission abstraction**.

---

## 8️⃣ Primary vs Supplementary Groups (Deep Truth)

### Primary Group

- Exactly one per user
    
- Stored in `/etc/passwd`
    
- Default group for new files
    

### Supplementary Groups

- Multiple allowed
    
- Stored in `/etc/group`
    
- Grant additional access
    

Changing behavior with `setgid`.

---

## 9️⃣ useradd vs adduser (Truth Table)

|Aspect|useradd|adduser|
|---|---|---|
|Level|Low|High|
|Interactive|❌|✅|
|Scriptable|✅|⚠️|
|Defaults|Minimal|Human-friendly|

Admins prefer **useradd in scripts**, **adduser on desktops**.

---

## 🔟 Group-Based Access Control (Patterns)

### Pattern 1: Project Group

```text
projectA → groupA
```

Benefits:

- No per-user permissions
    
- Easy onboarding/offboarding
    

---

### Pattern 2: Role-Based Groups

```text
sudo, docker, admins
```

Assign roles instead of permissions.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ File Ownership & Permission Resolution

Resolution order:

1. Owner
    
2. Group
    
3. Others
    

Kernel checks **IDs**, not names.

Example:

```bash
ls -l file
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ setgid, umask & Collaboration

### setgid Directory

```bash
chmod g+s /shared
```

Effect:

- New files inherit group
    

### umask

```bash
umask 002
```

Ensures group write access.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Advanced Permission Scenarios

### Shared Development Folder

```bash
groupadd dev
chown :dev /project
chmod 2775 /project
```

Prevents permission conflicts.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Auditing & Troubleshooting

Key commands:

```bash
id user
groups user
getent passwd
group user
```

Find access failures:

```bash
namei -l path
```

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Security Best Practices

- Use groups, not users
    
- Avoid root where possible
    
- Remove users cleanly
    
- Audit group membership regularly
    

Avoid permission creep.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Enterprise & Server Scenarios

- LDAP / Active Directory
    
- Centralized identity
    
- sudo via group policy
    

Local users become **identity clients**.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Hands-On Labs

Beginner:

```bash
id
```

Intermediate:

```bash
mkdir /shared
chmod 2770 /shared
```

Advanced:

```bash
find / -gid dev
```

✅ This guide is written for **Linux administrators, security engineers, DevOps, and embedded Linux developers**.

Understanding users and groups means understanding **Linux security itself**.

Happy administering 🐧🔐
