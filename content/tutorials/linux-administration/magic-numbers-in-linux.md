## 1️⃣ What Magic Numbers _Really_ Are

Magic numbers are **constant byte sequences embedded into binary data structures** to provide **early identification hints** for:

- File formats
    
- Executables
    
- Disk layouts
    
- Network protocols
    

They act as a _weak contract_ between producers and consumers of binary data.

Key properties:

- Positioned at **well-known offsets**
    
- **Endian-aware** when numeric
    
- Designed for **fast rejection** of invalid data
    

---

## 2️⃣ Why File Extensions Fail

|Problem|Explanation|
|---|---|
|User-controlled|Filenames are arbitrary|
|Ambiguous|`.dat`, `.bin` mean nothing|
|Spoofable|`evil.exe → photo.jpg`|

Linux always trusts **content over name**.

---

## 3️⃣ Magic Numbers vs MIME Types

|Aspect|Magic Numbers|MIME|
|---|---|---|
|Source|Binary content|Mapping rules|
|Trust|High|Medium|
|Used by|Kernel / tools|Desktop / browsers|

`file --mime-type` bridges both worlds.

---

## 4️⃣ Kernel vs User Space Detection

### Kernel

- Does **not** rely on file magic
    
- Executes ELF only if loaders exist
    
- Uses **shebang (`#!`)** interception
    

### User Space

- `file`, desktops, scanners
    
- Powered by **libmagic**
    

---

## 5️⃣ libmagic Architecture

Execution pipeline:

```
open() → read() → pattern engine
     → indirect offsets
     → strength scoring
     → description synthesis
```

Capabilities:

- Conditional rules
    
- Nested patterns
    
- Offset arithmetic
    

---

## 6️⃣ File Header Layouts

Example (PNG):

```
Offset  Size  Meaning
0x00    8     Signature
0x08    4     IHDR length
```

Magic numbers rarely act alone — they validate **structure presence**, not full correctness.

---

## 7️⃣ Common Magic Numbers (Extended)

|Format|Hex|Offset|
|---|---|---|
|ELF|7F 45 4C 46|0x00|
|PDF|25 50 44 46|0x00|
|PE|4D 5A|0x00|
|Mach-O|FE ED FA CE|0x00|
|GPT|45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54|0x200|

Notice: not all magic appears at offset 0.

---

## 8️⃣ ELF Internals

Beyond magic:

- e_ident[EI_CLASS]
    
- e_ident[EI_DATA]
    
- Program headers
    

Use:

```bash
readelf -h file
```

---

## 9️⃣ Executable Detection & Shebang

`#!` works by kernel loader redirection:

```
#! /usr/bin/python3
```

Kernel steps:

1. Reads first 2 bytes
    
2. Parses interpreter path
    
3. Re-execs
    

---

## 🔟 Disk Structures as Magic Numbers

### MBR

- Offset 510 → `0x55AA`
    

### GPT

- Primary header at LBA 1
    
- Magic = `EFI PART`
    

Disk formats **are file formats**.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Byte-Level Inspection

Essential tools:

```bash
xxd -l 64 file
hexdump -C file
od -An -tx1 file
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Writing File Detectors

Python example:

```python
magic = f.read(4)
```

C example:

```c
memcmp(buf, "\x7FELF", 4)
```

Avoid trusting magic alone.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Advanced Magic Files

Features:

- Indirect offsets
    
- Numeric comparisons
    
- Strength modifiers
    

Example:

```
0  string  ELF
>4 byte =2 64-bit ELF
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Security Implications

Threats:

- Polyglot files
    
- Content spoofing
    
- Malformed headers
    

Mitigations:

- Full structure validation
    
- Size & bounds checking
    
- Sandboxing
    

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Reverse Engineering

Magic numbers help identify:

- Packed binaries
    
- Firmware
    
- Unknown dumps
    

Paired with:

- `binwalk`
    
- `strings`
    
- `radare2`
    

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Cross-Platform Notes

|OS|Format|
|---|---|
|Linux|ELF|
|Windows|PE|
|macOS|Mach-O|

Multi-format binaries exist.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Performance Considerations

- Early short-circuit
    
- Read minimal bytes
    
- Cache detection results
    

Used heavily by antivirus engines.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Practical Labs

Beginner → dump headers  
Intermediate → parse MBR  
Advanced → implement detector  
Expert → fuzz malformed headers

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Further Reading

- `man magic`
    
- libmagic source
    
- OSDev Wiki
    
- ELF Specification

✅ This document is written for **Linux system programmers, reverse engineers, security researchers, and low-level developers**.

Understanding magic numbers means understanding how **systems recognize reality from raw bytes**.

Happy hacking 🐧
