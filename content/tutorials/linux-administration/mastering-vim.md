## 1️⃣ Philosophy of Vim

Vim is **not a text editor** in the traditional sense. It is a **language for manipulating text**.

Key ideas:

- You describe _what_ to edit, not _how_
    
- Editing is faster than thinking
    
- The keyboard is the primary interface
    

> "Vim rewards thinking in motions and transformations, not keystrokes."

## 2️⃣ Vim Mental Model

### Vim Grammar

```
[count] + operator + motion = edit
```

Examples:

- `dw` → delete word
    
- `3j` → move down 3 lines
    
- `ci(` → change inside parentheses
    

This composability is Vim's true power.

## 3️⃣ Modes in Depth

|Mode|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Normal|Navigation + commands|
|Insert|Text input|
|Visual|Selection|
|Command|Ex commands (`:`)|
|Replace|Overwrite mode|
|Terminal|Embedded shell|

Mode switching is deliberate—**not accidental**.

## 4️⃣ Motions, Operators & Text Objects

### Motions (Navigation)

- `w`, `b`, `e` → Jump by words (forward, backward, end of word).
    
- `%` → Jump between matching pairs (like `( )` or `{ }`).
    

**Inline Jumps (Simplified):**

- `f<char>` **(Find):** Press `f` then type any letter. The cursor will jump and land **directly on** the next matching letter on the same line. _(Example: Press `f` then `x` -> jumps exactly to the next 'x')._
    
- `t<char>` **(Till):** Press `t` then type any letter. The cursor will jump and land **just before** the next matching letter. _(Example: Press `t` then `x` -> jumps right before the next 'x')._
    

### Operators (Actions)

- `d` → delete (cut)
    
- `y` → yank (copy)
    
- `c` → change (delete and enter Insert mode)
    
- `>`, `<` → indent / un-indent
    

### Text Objects (Context)

- `iw`, `aw` → inner word, around word
    
- `i(`, `i{`, `i"` → inside parentheses, braces, quotes
    

**Example Combos:**

```
ci"  " Change inside quotes
di(  " Delete inside parentheses
yap  " Yank (copy) around paragraph
```

## 5️⃣ Counts & Composability

Everything is repeatable by typing a number first:

```
10dd  " Delete 10 lines
5>>   " Indent 5 lines
3ciw  " Change the next 3 words
```

Vim scales with file size effortlessly.

## 6️⃣ Undo Tree & Time Travel

Vim has a **non-linear undo tree**, meaning you never truly lose your edit history.

**Key commands (Simplified):**

- `u` → **Undo**: Press `u` to undo the last action.
    
- `<C-r>` → **Redo**: Press and hold `Ctrl` and then press `r`. This redoes the action you just undid.
    
- `:undolist` → View the branches of your undo history.
    

Persist undo history across restarts (add to `.vimrc`):

```
set undofile
set undodir=~/.vim/undo
```

## 7️⃣ Insert Mode Power

- `ctrl` / `<C-p>` → Auto-completion (Next/Previous match) (Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p).
    
- `<C-r>0` → Paste from register `0` while in insert mode (Ctrl+r, then 0).
    
- `<C-o>` → Execute a single Normal mode command and immediately return to Insert mode.
    

_Rule of thumb: Avoid staying in Insert mode unless you are actively typing new text._

## 8️⃣ Visual Mode Mastery

|Mode|Key|Action|
|---|---|---|
|Visual|`v`|Select character by character|
|Line Visual|`V`|Select whole lines|
|Block Visual|`<C-v>`|Select a rectangular block of text (Ctrl+v)|

**Block editing example (Comment out multiple lines):**

```
<C-v>jjI// <Esc>
```

_(Select block downwards with `jj`, press `I` to insert, type `//` , then hit `Esc` to apply to all selected lines)._

## 9️⃣ Advanced Navigation

- `:jumps` → Show jump list
    
- `:changes` → Show change list
    
- `gg=G` → Re-indent the entire file automatically
    
- `zz`, `zt`, `zb` → Scroll screen so cursor is in the Middle (`zz`), Top (`zt`), or Bottom (`zb`) of the viewport.
    

## 🔟 Search, Replace & Regex

**Global replace:**

```
:%s/foo/bar/gc
```

_(Search for 'foo', replace with 'bar', `g` = global on line, `c` = ask for confirmation)._

**Regex groups:**

```
:%s/\(foo\)/[\1]/g
```

**Very magic mode (Simplified Regex):**

```
:%s\v(foo|bar)/baz/g
```

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Buffers, Windows & Tabs

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Buffer**|The actual file loaded in memory.|
|**Window**|A viewport showing a buffer (split screen).|
|**Tab**|A collection of window layouts.|

> **Golden rule:** Buffers are files; windows are views; tabs are workspaces.

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Split Window Workflow

**Navigation:**

```
<C-w> h j k l  " Move cursor Left, Down, Up, Right between splits(Ctrl+w) then any one of them.
<C-w> =        " Equalize all split sizes
```

**Resize:**

```
<C-w> +        " Increase height
<C-w> <        " Decrease width
```

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Vimdiff (Professional Use)

Great for:

- Conflict resolution (Git merges)
    
- Configuration comparison
    
- Code reviews
    

**Diff modes commands:**

```
:diffget  " Pull changes from the other window
:diffput  " Push changes to the other window
```

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Registers (All of Them)

Registers are like multiple clipboards.

|Register|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`"`|Default (unnamed) register|
|`0`|Last yank (copy) - extremely useful!|
|`1-9`|Delete history|
|`_`|Black hole register (deleting here doesn't overwrite your clipboard)|
|`+`|System clipboard (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V in other apps)|

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Clipboard Internals

Never destroy your clipboard when deleting:

```
"_dd  " Deletes the line into the black hole register
```

Recommended setting to sync Vim with OS clipboard:

```
set clipboard=unnamedplus
```

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Marks, Jumps & Change Lists

Power commands:

- `mA` → Create a global mark named 'A'
    
- `'a` vs `` `a `` → Jump to line of mark 'a' vs jump to exact line AND column.
    
- `<C-i>` / `<C-o>` → Navigate forward/backward through your jump history (Ctrl+i / Ctrl+o).
    

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Macros at Scale

Record reusable logic to automate repetitive tasks:

```
qa     " Start recording macro into register 'a'
...    " (do your edits)
q      " Stop recording
10@a   " Execute macro 'a' 10 times
```

**Editable macros:**

```
:let @a='ddj'
```

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Command-Line Mode Power

**Command History Window:**

```
q:
```

**Shell access from inside Vim:**

```
:!gcc %     " Compile current file
:r !date    " Read output of 'date' command and paste it into buffer
```

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Vimscript Fundamentals

Basic structure:

```
let g:var = 1
if g:var == 1
  echo "Hello Vim"
endif
```

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Custom Commands & Functions

```
command! Build make
function! Run()
  echo "Running..."
endfunction
```

## 2️⃣1️⃣ Plugin Ecosystem

**Principles:**

- Minimal plugins (Keep it fast)
    
- Learn native ways before installing a plugin
    

**Must-know plugins:**

- `vim-fugitive` (Git integration)
    
- `fzf.vim` (Fuzzy file finder)
    
- `vim-surround` (Easily change quotes, brackets, tags)
    

## 2️⃣2️⃣ LSP & IDE Power

With `coc.nvim` or `nvim-lsp` (Neovim), Vim becomes a full IDE:

- Go-to-definition
    
- Refactoring
    
- Diagnostics & Linting
    

## 2️⃣3️⃣ Git & Build Integration

```
:Git status  " Requires vim-fugitive
:make        " Run your build tool
:copen       " Open quickfix window to see errors
```

## 2️⃣4️⃣ Performance

Speed tips:

- Disable syntax highlighting for massive files.
    
- Lazy-load plugins so they only start when needed.
    

## 2️⃣5️⃣ Security

- Avoid executing modelines from unknown files.
    
- Always read scripts/plugins before sourcing them.
    

## 2️⃣6️⃣ Learning Path

1. Motions & operators (The grammar)
    
2. Text objects (The context)
    
3. Macros (Automation)
    
4. Registers (Memory)
    
5. Vimscript (Customization)
