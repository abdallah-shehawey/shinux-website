Secondary drives — an NTFS Windows partition, a shared data disk — don't mount themselves on every boot unless `/etc/fstab` tells the kernel to do it. This walks through adding fstab entries safely, with the flags that matter for NTFS specifically.

> **Warning:** editing `/etc/fstab` incorrectly can prevent the system from booting. Back it up first:

> sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak

## Find the Partition's Uuid and Filesystem Type

```bash
sudo blkid
```

This prints each partition's **UUID** (e.g. `7C9EBC0D9EBBBE48`) and **TYPE** (e.g. `ntfs`, `ext4`, `exfat`) — both needed for the fstab entry.

## Edit `/etc/fstab`

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/fstab
```

## Add the Mount Entry

General syntax:

```ini
UUID=<uuid> <mount_point> <filesystem_type> <options> <dump> <pass>
```

For NTFS partitions specifically, these options avoid the usual permission headaches:

```ini
# Mount Local_Disk
UUID=7C9EBC0D9EBBBE48 /media/abdallah-shehawey/Local_Disk ntfs-3g defaults,nofail,x-gvfs-show,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022 0 0

# Mount WinOS
UUID=01DC06CA66C0E3F0 /media/abdallah-shehawey/WinOS ntfs-3g defaults,nofail,x-gvfs-show,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022 0 0
```

Make sure the mount point directories exist first:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/abdallah-shehawey/Local_Disk
```

**What each option does:**

- `defaults` — the standard mount options.
- `nofail` — critical for external/secondary drives: if the drive is missing or unreadable, the system still boots instead of hanging waiting for it.
- `x-gvfs-show` — makes the drive show up in a file manager's sidebar (Nautilus, etc.).
- `uid=1000,gid=1000` — makes the primary user the owner of the files, so reads/writes don't need root.
- `umask=0022` — the default permission mask for new files on the mount.

## Verify Before Rebooting

Don't reboot yet — a typo in `fstab` can otherwise leave the system stuck at boot. Instead, mount everything fstab defines and check for errors:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

No errors means the entries are correct, and the drives will mount automatically on every subsequent boot.
