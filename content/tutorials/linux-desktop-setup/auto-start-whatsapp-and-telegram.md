Many daily applications don't natively support starting minimized to the system tray on Linux desktop startup. This guide shows how to set up autostart for the Flatpak versions of WhatsApp and Telegram, detailing how to script window closing with `wmctrl` and utilize native start-hidden flags.

## 🟢 WhatsApp

Since WhatsApp's Flatpak does not have a native `--start-in-tray` or `--minimized` flag, we can work around this by launching it normally and using `wmctrl` to programmatically close the window immediately after launch. In most desktop environments, closing the main window of a messaging app keeps it running in the background/system tray.

### Step 1: Install `wmctrl`
`wmctrl` is a CLI tool that interacts with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager. Install it using your package manager:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wmctrl
```

### Step 2: Create a Launch Script
Create a simple shell script to launch WhatsApp, wait for it to start, and then tell the window manager to close its window.
```bash
nvim ~/.local/bin/whatsapp-hidden.sh
```

Add the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Launch WhatsApp Desktop via Flatpak in the background
flatpak run io.github.mimbrero.WhatsAppDesktop &

# Wait a couple of seconds for the window to render
sleep 2

# Close the window gracefully (keeps it in the tray)
wmctrl -c "WhatsApp"
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/whatsapp-hidden.sh
```

### Step 3: Create an Autostart Entry
To run this script automatically when you log in, create a `.desktop` file in your user's autostart directory:
```bash
nvim ~/.config/autostart/whatsapp.desktop
```

Add the following configuration:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=WhatsApp (Hidden)
Exec=/home/abdallah-shehawey/.local/bin/whatsapp-hidden.sh
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=2
```

Make the desktop entry executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/whatsapp.desktop
```

### Alternative: Using Native Flags (if supported)
If the Flatpak wrapper or electron client updates to support hidden startup, you can skip the helper script entirely and edit your `whatsapp.desktop` directly:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=WhatsApp (Hidden)
Exec=flatpak run io.github.mimbrero.WhatsAppDesktop --start-hidden
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=2
```

## 🔵 Telegram

Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram has built-in support for starting minimized in the system tray, making it much easier to configure.

### Step 1: Create the Telegram Autostart Entry
Create a desktop entry directly in the autostart folder:
```bash
nvim ~/.config/autostart/telegram.desktop
```

### Step 2: Configure with the `-startintray` Flag
Add the configuration, using the `-startintray` parameter in the execution line:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Telegram (Flatpak)
Exec=flatpak run org.telegram.desktop -startintray
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
```

Make the file executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/telegram.desktop
```
