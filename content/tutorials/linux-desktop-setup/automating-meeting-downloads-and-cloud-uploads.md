Downloading and backing up long meeting recordings (such as Microsoft Teams or SharePoint streams) can consume substantial local disk space and bandwidth. This guide walks through configuring a pipeline script that downloads video streams using `yt-dlp` with authenticated cookies, uploads them to a specific Google Drive folder using `rclone`, and cleans up the local files.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this pipeline, you need two utilities:

### 1. `yt-dlp`
An advanced command-line downloader for video files from various sites (including Teams/SharePoint streams).
- Install on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install yt-dlp -y`
- Install on Fedora: `sudo dnf install yt-dlp -y`

### 2. `rclone`
A CLI program to sync files and directories to and from cloud storage services.
- Install on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install rclone -y`
- Install on Fedora: `sudo dnf install rclone -y`
- Configure Google Drive: Run `rclone config` and follow the interactive wizard to set up a remote named `gdrive`.

## 🔑 Exporting Authentication Cookies

SharePoint and Teams recordings are protected behind logins. To allow `yt-dlp` to download them, you need to export your browser's cookies:
1. Install a browser extension like *Get cookies.txt LOCALLY* or *EditThisCookie*.
2. Log in to your SharePoint/Teams account.
3. Export the cookies in Netscape format and save them as `$HOME/cookies.txt`.

## 📝 The Automation Script

Save the following Bash script as `auto_download_upload.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/videos_downloaded"
COOKIE_FILE="$HOME/cookies.txt"
DRIVE_FOLDER="gdrive:15Py9VYjQivP8TzeFCDqkDi9G75pQZXF9"

# Create download folder if it does not exist
mkdir -p "$DOWNLOAD_DIR"

# Array of target meeting URLs
links=(
"https://sharepoint-link-1..."
"https://sharepoint-link-2..."
)

echo "🚀 Starting download-upload pipeline..."

for link in "${links[@]}"; do
    echo "⬇️ Downloading video..."

    yt-dlp \
        --cookies "$COOKIE_FILE" \
        --continue \
        --no-part \
        --concurrent-fragments 5 \
        --retries 10 \
        --fragment-retries 10 \
        --file-access-retries 10 \
        --output "$DOWNLOAD_DIR/%(title)s.%(ext)s" \
        "$link"

    # Find the most recently downloaded file in the folder
    FILE=$(ls -t "$DOWNLOAD_DIR" | head -n 1)

    echo "☁️ Uploading $FILE to Google Drive..."
    rclone copy "$DOWNLOAD_DIR/$FILE" "$DRIVE_FOLDER" -P

    echo "🧹 Cleaning up: deleting local copy..."
    rm "$DOWNLOAD_DIR/$FILE"
done

echo "✅ All Done!"
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x auto_download_upload.sh
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Sequential Queue**: By looping through the list, the script ensures only one video is downloaded at a time. This prevents running out of local disk space.
2. **Robust `yt-dlp` Options**:
   - `--cookies`: Passes session cookies for authentication.
   - `--concurrent-fragments 5`: Speeds up downloads by fetching up to 5 parts in parallel.
   - `--retries` and `--fragment-retries`: Auto-resumes downloads on network hiccups.
3. **`rclone copy`**: Copies the file to the Google Drive folder specified by the folder ID (`15Py9VY...`). The `-P` flag prints transfer progress in real-time.
4. **Immediate Cleanup**: The local file is deleted immediately after the upload completes successfully, keeping local storage usage minimal.
5. **Idempotence**: The `--continue` flag in `yt-dlp` means that if the script is interrupted and re-run, it will pick up exactly where it left off.
