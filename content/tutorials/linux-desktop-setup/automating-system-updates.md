Keeping a Linux desktop current means touching several update mechanisms every time: the system package manager, Flatpak, GNOME extensions, and firmware. Running each one by hand gets old fast, so it's worth wrapping them in a single script — one for Ubuntu, one for Fedora — that updates everything except NVIDIA drivers by default (those are best updated deliberately, not as a side effect of a routine update).

## What the Script Covers

Both scripts do the same job on their respective distro:

- Full system package update
- Flatpak updates
- GNOME extensions update
- Firmware updates (Fedora, via `fwupd`)
- Cleanup of unused packages afterward
- NVIDIA drivers **skipped by default**, with an explicit `--with-nvidia` flag to opt in

## Installing the Script

Save the script as an executable on your `$PATH` so it's callable as a plain command:

```bash
sudo nvim /usr/local/bin/update-every-thing
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update-every-thing
```

Usage is identical on both distros:

```text
update-every-thing              # normal update, NVIDIA skipped
update-every-thing --with-nvidia # also update NVIDIA drivers
```

## The Ubuntu Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script: update-every-thing
# Function: Update everything in Ubuntu
# Default: skip NVIDIA drivers
# Option: --with-nvidia

echo "Starting full Ubuntu update..."

WITH_NVIDIA=false

if [[ "$1" == "--with-nvidia" ]]; then
  WITH_NVIDIA=true
  echo "NVIDIA drivers WILL be updated."
else
  echo "NVIDIA drivers will be skipped."
  sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-driver-* nvidia-dkms-* nvidia-kernel-* libnvidia-* >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y linux-generic
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt autoclean -y

sudo snap refresh
flatpak update -y

pro security-status || true
sudo pro fix || true

gnome-extensions update || true
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall || true

if [ "$WITH_NVIDIA" = false ]; then
  sudo apt-mark unhold nvidia-driver-* nvidia-dkms-* nvidia-kernel-* libnvidia-* >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

echo "Update finished!"
```

The key trick is `apt-mark hold`/`unhold`: instead of trying to exclude NVIDIA packages from an `apt upgrade` run (fragile with wildcards), the script freezes them before the upgrade and unfreezes them right after, so a normal upgrade simply can't touch them unless `--with-nvidia` was passed.

## The Fedora Script

The Fedora version in this repository includes a robust **retry mechanism** for network-dependent commands (like repository updates, firmware downloads, and Flatpaks) so that network instability or temporary server issues do not abort the entire update sequence.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Script: update-everything-fedora-retry
# Function: Update everything in Fedora with retry mechanism

set -e

# A retry helper that loops indefinitely until the command exits successfully
retry_command() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local name="$2"

    while true; do
        echo "🔄 Trying: $name..."

        if eval "$cmd"; then
            echo "✅ $name finished successfully"
            break
        else
            echo "❌ $name failed, retrying in 2 seconds..."
            sleep 2
        fi
    done
}

echo "🚀 Starting full Fedora update..."

# DNF Package & Repository Update
retry_command "sudo dnf upgrade -y --refresh" "DNF System Update"

# Firmware Updates
retry_command "sudo fwupdmgr refresh --force" "fwupd refresh"
retry_command "sudo fwupdmgr update -y" "fwupd update"

# Flatpak Packages
if command -v flatpak &> /dev/null; then
    retry_command "flatpak update -y" "Flatpak Update"
fi

# GNOME Extensions (via RPM packages)
if command -v gnome-extensions &> /dev/null; then
    retry_command "sudo dnf upgrade -y 'gnome-shell-extension-*'" "GNOME Extensions Update"

    echo "📋 Installed GNOME extensions:"
    gnome-extensions list || true
fi

echo "🎉 All updates completed successfully!"
```

### Why the Retry Helper is Critical

Updating packages on Linux often fails due to:
1. **Repository Mirrors**: A specific mirror might temporarily time out or return a gateway error.
2. **Network Drops**: Temporary Wi-Fi or router drops.
3. **Flatpak Hubs**: Flathub occasionally experiences high-traffic load causing temporary connection errors.

By wrapping commands in the `retry_command` function, the script keeps trying the operation after a 2-second sleep until it successfully completes, ensuring you don't return to an unfinished update.

> **Notes:**
>
> - The DNF command refresh ensures your packages cache is forced to synchronize with the mirrors.
> - The `set -e` flag ensures the script exits immediately if any un-handled command fails outside the retry helper.
> - The script checks if `flatpak` and `gnome-extensions` commands exist before running them, making it safe to run on systems without Flatpak or GNOME desktops.
