Changing the icon GNOME shows for a specific file type — say, giving `.md` files their own icon instead of a generic text-file icon — doesn't require touching the system's Adwaita theme or any application icons. GNOME's icon-theme inheritance model makes it possible to override exactly one MIME icon safely.

## The Core Idea

Instead of modifying `hicolor` or a system theme directly, create a small custom icon theme that **inherits** from the current system theme (usually Adwaita) and overrides only the one MIME icon needed. GNOME automatically falls back to the parent theme for everything else, so application icons, Wine icons, and web-app icons (Brave, Chrome, etc.) are never affected.

## Theme Directory Structure

```text
~/.local/share/icons/<theme-name>/
├── index.theme
└── <size>/<context>/
    └── <mime-icon-name>.png
```

Where `<size>` is something like `128x128`, `<context>` is `mimetypes`, and `<mime-icon-name>` is the icon name for that MIME type.

## `index.theme` Template

```ini
[Icon Theme]
Name=Custom MIME Icons
Comment=User-level MIME icon overrides
Inherits=Adwaita
Directories=128x128/mimetypes

[128x128/mimetypes]
Size=128
Type=Fixed
Context=MimeTypes
```

GNOME resolves icons by checking the active theme first; if the icon isn't found there, it falls back to whatever `Inherits=` points at — which is what keeps this approach safe.

## Worked Example: a Custom `.md` Icon

**Identify the MIME type:**

```text
xdg-mime query filetype README.md
# text/markdown  →  icon name: text-markdown
```

**Create the theme directory:**

```text
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons/md-custom/128x128/mimetypes
```

**Create `index.theme`:**

```text
nano ~/.local/share/icons/md-custom/index.theme
```

```ini
[Icon Theme]
Name=Markdown Custom
Comment=Markdown icon override
Inherits=Adwaita
Directories=128x128/mimetypes

[128x128/mimetypes]
Size=128
Type=Fixed
Context=MimeTypes
```

**Add the icon file**, named after the MIME icon name:

```text
cp markdown.png ~/.local/share/icons/md-custom/128x128/mimetypes/text-markdown.png
```

**Activate the theme:**

```text
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'md-custom'
nautilus -q && nautilus &   # restart Files to pick it up
```

`.md` files now use the custom icon; every other file type, and all application icons, stay exactly as they were.

## Extending to Other File Types

| File Type | MIME Type | Icon Name | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.md` | `text/markdown` | `text-markdown` | mimetypes |
| `.py` | `text/x-python` | `text-x-python` | mimetypes |
| `.c` | `text/x-c` | `text-x-c` | mimetypes |
| `.pdf` | `application/pdf` | `application-pdf` | mimetypes |

## Reverting

```text
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'Adwaita'
```

> **What not to do:** don't modify `hicolor` directly, don't rename a PNG to a `.svg` extension expecting it to work, and don't change the system-wide icon theme instead of layering a user-level one.
