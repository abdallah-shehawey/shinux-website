Zsh is an extremely customizable shell. By pairing it with Oh My Zsh, custom plugins, and a fine-tuned configuration, you can significantly boost your terminal productivity. This guide walks through setting up Zsh, installing critical plugins, and implementing custom features like prompt toggles and auto-newline spacing.

## 📦 Prerequisites and Installation

### Step 1: Install Zsh
Install Zsh using your package manager:
```bash
sudo apt install zsh -y
```

### Step 2: Install Oh My Zsh
Oh My Zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Step 3: Install Recommended Plugins
We will install two productivity plugins directly into the custom Oh My Zsh folder:
- **zsh-autosuggestions**: Suggests commands as you type based on history.
- **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: Colors commands as you type, highlighting syntax errors in red.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## ⚙️ Applying and Switching Configs

Backup your current config before copying the custom `.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Backup existing config
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup

# Copy new config from dotfiles
cp ./configs/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# Reload configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Make Zsh your default shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Make sure the plugins are also installed system-wide on Debian/Ubuntu to work seamlessly:
```bash
sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions -y
```

## ⚡ Highlighted Features of this Configuration

This custom configuration includes several advanced productivity settings.

### 1. Smart Options (`setopt`)
- **`autocd`**: Allows you to change directory simply by typing its path (e.g. typing `Documents` instead of `cd Documents`).
- **`numericglobsort`**: Sorts matched filenames numerically (e.g. processing files `1`, `2`, `10` in correct order instead of alphabetical `1`, `10`, `2`).
- **`interactivecomments`**: Allows putting comments (starting with `#`) inside interactive shell sessions.

### 2. Convenient Custom Keybindings
- **`Shift + Tab`**: Maps to `undo`, allowing you to undo typing modifications.
- **`Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow`**: Moves the cursor word-by-word.
- **`Ctrl + Backspace`**: Deletes an entire word backwards.

### 3. Dynamic Prompt Customization
The prompt includes git status integration displaying current branch and upstream target (e.g., `(main -> origin)`). 

#### 🔄 Dynamic Prompt Toggle (`Ctrl + P`)
You can instantly toggle between a clean **one-line** prompt and an detailed **two-line** prompt (showing complete paths) by pressing `Ctrl + P`:
```bash
toggle_oneline_prompt(){
    if [ "$PROMPT_ALTERNATIVE" = oneline ]; then
        PROMPT_ALTERNATIVE=twoline
    else
        PROMPT_ALTERNATIVE=oneline
    fi
    configure_prompt
    zle reset-prompt
}
zle -N toggle_oneline_prompt
bindkey ^P toggle_oneline_prompt
```

### 4. Smart Command Padding Hook
To keep terminal output clean and readable, a custom `preexec` and `precmd` hook automatically inserts a newline between the output of the previous command and the next prompt, unless clearing commands (like `clear` or `reset`) are executed:
```bash
typeset -g __ADD_NL=0

preexec() {
  __ADD_NL=1
  case "$1" in
    clear|reset|cls|*'tput reset'*) __ADD_NL=0 ;;
  esac
}

precmd() {
    print -Pnr -- "$TERM_TITLE"
    if (( __ADD_NL )); then
        echo
        __ADD_NL=0
    fi
}
```

### 5. Colorized Tools
The config sets up custom `$LS_COLORS` to colorize commands like `grep`, `diff`, `ip`, and `ls`. It also exports variables like `LESS_TERMCAP_*` to colorize page navigation inside `man` and `less` manuals.
```bash
export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'\E[1;36m'     # bold cyan for headers
export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'\E[1;32m'     # underline green for variables
```
