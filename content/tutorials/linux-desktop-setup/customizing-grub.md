GRUB's default look is purely functional. Installing a theme and tuning a couple of settings makes boot feel intentional instead of accidental, and along the way it's worth knowing how to regenerate the GRUB config correctly on both Ubuntu and Fedora, since the two differ.

## 1. Download a theme

Sites like [GNOME-Look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109) host GRUB themes. Always check the theme's README first — many ship an `install.sh` that automates the rest.

## 2. Extract it

```bash
tar -xvf theme-file.tar.gz
```

A typical theme (e.g. Vimix) extracts to something like:

```text
Vimix-4k/
├── install.sh
├── LICENSE
└── Vimix/
```

## 3. Install via `install.sh` (preferred, when available)

```bash
cd Vimix-4k
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer typically copies theme files to `/usr/share/grub/themes/`, asks which resolution variant to use, and regenerates the GRUB config automatically.

## 4. Picking the right resolution variant

Getting this wrong stretches or blurs the GRUB UI. Check the actual screen resolution first:

```bash
xrandr | grep '*'
```

| Screen Resolution | Recommended Theme |
| --- | --- |
| 1366×768 | 1080p |
| 1920×1080 | 1080p |
| 2560×1440 | 2k |
| 3840×2160 | 4k |

If asked to pick, always choose the closest resolution **at or below** the actual screen resolution — never higher.

## 5. Manual installation (no `install.sh`)

```bash
sudo cp -r theme-folder-name /usr/share/grub/themes/
sudo nvim /etc/default/grub
```

Add or update:

```bash
GRUB_THEME="/usr/share/grub/themes/theme-folder-name/theme.txt"
```

## 6. Regenerating the GRUB config

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

Fedora does **not** use `update-grub`:

```bash
# BIOS systems
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

# UEFI systems (most modern laptops)
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
```

Check which mode a system is running in:

```bash
[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo UEFI || echo BIOS
```

On Fedora, themes commonly live under `/usr/share/grub/themes/` — double-check `theme.txt` actually exists there and that `GRUB_THEME` points at it exactly.

## 7. If the theme doesn't show up

Usual suspects: Secure Boot blocking custom themes, a wrong `theme.txt` path, or a config that was never regenerated after the edit. Re-running the regenerate command for the relevant boot mode is the first thing to try:

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
```

> **Fedora + HiDPI tip:** if GRUB renders too small on a 4K screen, add to `/etc/default/grub` and regenerate:
>
> ```bash
> GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
> GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
> ```
