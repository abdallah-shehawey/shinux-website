Distrobox lets you run a full container of another distro — Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, whatever — fully integrated with your host: shared home directory, shared GPU, shared themes, apps exported straight into your host's app menu. It's the practical way to get AUR packages on Fedora, or a Debian toolchain on Arch, without dual-booting or babysitting a VM. This guide covers installing it on Fedora, creating an Arch container with NVIDIA GPU passthrough, using AUR inside it, and exporting GUI apps back to the host.

## Install Distrobox on Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install distrobox
sudo dnf install podman
distrobox --version
```

## Create an Arch Linux Container

```text
distrobox create --name arch --image archlinux:latest
```

For NVIDIA GPU support (CUDA, AI workloads, gaming, GPU rendering), pass `--nvidia` explicitly:

```text
distrobox create \
  --name arch \
  --image archlinux:latest \
  --nvidia
```

`--nvidia` mounts the NVIDIA device files into the container and shares the host's driver libraries, enabling CUDA/OpenGL/Vulkan acceleration inside Arch. Before using it:

- NVIDIA drivers must already be correctly installed on the Fedora host.
- `nvidia-smi` must work on the host.
- Don't run `distrobox create` with `sudo` — rootless is the supported mode.

Verify the host GPU first:

```text
nvidia-smi
```

If that works on Fedora, the GPU will work inside the container too. Enter it with:

```text
distrobox enter arch
```

## First-time Arch Setup

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
```

## Install Yay (aur Helper)

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
yay -S google-chrome   # test it
```

## Installing an Aur Package (example: Whatsapp)

```text
yay -S whatsapp-for-linux
```

If prompted for a clean build: choose `A` for a clean build, `q` to exit the diff view, then confirm with `Y`. Launch with:

```text
whatsapp-for-linux
```

## Exporting Arch Apps Back to Fedora

```text
distrobox-export --app whatsapp-for-linux
```

This adds the app to Fedora's own application menu, even though it's actually running inside the Arch container.

## Nvidia Gpu Usage Inside the Container

```bash
nvidia-smi                      # confirm the host driver works
sudo pacman -S nvidia-utils      # install matching utils inside Arch
nvidia-smi                       # confirm again, inside the container
```

On hybrid GPU (Optimus) laptops, force the NVIDIA GPU for a specific program:

```ini
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia program-name
```

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

**Don't delete `~/.cache` during setup.** Distrobox stores required state in `~/.cache/distrobox/`. If it does get corrupted:

```text
distrobox rm arch
rm -rf ~/.cache/distrobox
```

Then recreate the container.

**Error: `crun: ptsname: Inappropriate ioctl for device`** — usually an interrupted setup or stale terminal session. Fix with:

```text
podman system reset
```

Or just reboot / log out and back in.

## Removing the Container

```text
distrobox rm arch
```

> **Key notes:**
>
> - Arch inside Distrobox does not affect the Fedora host system.
> - The home directory, GPU, sound, and themes are all shared/integrated automatically.
> - You can experiment freely inside the container — a broken Arch install is a two-command fix (`distrobox rm` + recreate).
