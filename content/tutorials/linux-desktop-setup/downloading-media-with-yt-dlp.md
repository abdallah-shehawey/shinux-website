`yt-dlp` is an actively-maintained fork of `youtube-dl` for downloading video and audio from YouTube and hundreds of other sites, with better performance and much more frequent updates than the project it forked from.

## Install on Ubuntu / Debian

**Via apt** (simplest):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp -y
```

**Via pip** (latest release, needs Python 3):

```text
python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp
```

**Standalone binary** (no dependencies to manage):

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
```

Verify with `yt-dlp --version` regardless of which method was used.

## Install on Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install yt-dlp -y
```

Or the same standalone-binary method shown above.

## Install on Windows

Download `yt-dlp.exe` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest), move it somewhere permanent (e.g. `C:\yt-dlp\`), and add that folder to `PATH` via "Edit the system environment variables" → Environment Variables → Path → New. Or, with Chocolatey installed:

```text
choco install yt-dlp -y
```

## Quick Usage Examples

```ini
# best quality video
yt-dlp "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# audio only, converted to mp3
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# a full playlist
yt-dlp -f best "PLAYLIST_URL"
```

## Keeping it Updated

If installed via the standalone binary or pip:

```text
yt-dlp -U
```
