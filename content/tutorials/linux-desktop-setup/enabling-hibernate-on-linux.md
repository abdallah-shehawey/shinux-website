Hibernate saves the entire contents of RAM to disk and powers the machine off completely; powering back on restores the session exactly where it was left, with no battery drain in between (unlike suspend-to-RAM). For it to work, three things need to be true: swap must exist, swap must be at least as large as RAM, and the kernel needs to be told where to find it at boot. The exact steps differ slightly between Debian-based distros and Fedora.

## Debian-based Distributions (ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_os)

**Check swap and RAM:**

```text
swapon --show
free -h
```

If `swapon --show` prints nothing, swap needs to be created first — see the swap-file guide.

**Find the swap UUID:**

```text
blkid
```

```ini
/dev/sda3: UUID="xxxx-xxxx" TYPE="swap"
```

**Configure GRUB** to tell the kernel where to resume from:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Change:

```ini
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

to:

```ini
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash resume=UUID=YOUR_SWAP_UUID"
```

**Apply and test:**

```bash
sudo update-grub
systemctl hibernate
```

## Fedora

Fedora uses Dracut instead of `initramfs-tools`, so rebuilding the initramfs is a separate, explicit step.

```text
swapon --show
blkid
```

Edit GRUB:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

```ini
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=UUID=YOUR_SWAP_UUID"
```

Rebuild the GRUB config — the path differs between BIOS and UEFI systems:

```text
# BIOS
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

# UEFI
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
```

Rebuild the initramfs so Dracut knows about the resume device:

```bash
sudo dracut -f
```

Test:

```text
systemctl hibernate
```

## Troubleshooting

Check whether the kernel reports hibernate support at all:

```bash
cat /sys/power/state
```

If `disk` appears in the output, hibernate is supported. If it fails to resume, check the boot log:

```text
journalctl -b
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - Swap must be large enough to hold the full RAM contents — undersized swap is the most common cause of a failed resume.
> - A swap file works, but a dedicated swap partition tends to be more reliable for resume-from-hibernate.
> - Secure Boot can occasionally interfere with the resume process; if hibernate silently fails to resume, that's worth ruling out.
