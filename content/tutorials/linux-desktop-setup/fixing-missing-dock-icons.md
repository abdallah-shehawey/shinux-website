Occasionally an app shows the right icon in the GNOME Applications menu, but once launched, the Dock displays a generic icon instead. That happens when GNOME can't match the running window to the app's `.desktop` file — usually because the window's `WM_CLASS` doesn't line up with what GNOME expects. Adding the correct `StartupWMClass` value fixes the mapping.

## 1. Find the running app's WM_CLASS

Open GNOME's built-in debugger:

```text
Alt + F2  →  type "lg"  →  Enter
```

This opens **Looking Glass**. Go to the **Windows** tab, find the app in the list, and copy the value shown next to `wmclass` — for example:

```text
wmclass: qpdfview.local.qpdfview
```

## 2. Add it to the `.desktop` file

```bash
nvim ~/.local/share/applications/appname.desktop
```

Add this line inside the `[Desktop Entry]` section:

```ini
StartupWMClass=<wmclass>
```

Example:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=qpdfview
Exec=qpdfview
Icon=qpdfview
StartupWMClass=qpdfview.local.qpdfview
```

## 3. Update the desktop database and re-log

```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

Log out and back in for GNOME to pick up the change.

## 4. Result

GNOME now correctly matches the running window to its `.desktop` file, and the Dock shows the proper icon instead of a generic placeholder.

> **Why this happens:** GNOME identifies running applications by a window's `WM_CLASS` (or app ID). If that value doesn't match anything in the `.desktop` file, the app is effectively "untracked" from the Dock's point of view. This is especially common with Qt applications, and can also show up when using a custom icon theme. It works the same way on both Wayland and X11.
