Managing online meetings and classes shouldn't require searching through emails or bookmarked folders. This guide shows how to set up `meet`, a custom Bash utility script that manages a local database of meeting URLs, letting you launch meetings interactively using `fzf` or directly by name.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before installing the script, ensure you have `fzf` (command-line fuzzy finder) installed for the interactive selection menu:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install fzf -y

# Fedora
sudo dnf install fzf -y
```

---

## 📝 The `meet` Script

Save the following script to a directory on your system's `$PATH`, such as `~/.local/bin/meet`:

```bash
nvim ~/.local/bin/meet
```

Add the following Bash code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file="$HOME/.meet/links"

mkdir -p "$HOME/.meet"
touch "$file"

# help menu
if [ "$1" = "--help" ] || [ "$1" = "-h" ]; then
    echo "meet - Simple Google Meet launcher"
    echo
    echo "Usage:"
    echo "  meet                     Open interactive selector"
    echo "  meet <name>              Open saved meeting directly"
    echo "  meet --add <name> <url>  Add a new meeting"
    echo "  meet --delete <name>     Delete a saved meeting"
    echo "  meet --help              Show this help message"
    exit 0
fi

# add new meeting
if [ "$1" = "--add" ]; then
    name="$2"
    url="$3"

    if [ -z "$name" ] || [ -z "$url" ]; then
        echo "Usage: meet --add <name> <url>"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Prevent duplicates
    if grep -q "^$name " "$file"; then
        echo "Meeting name already exists: $name"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "$name $url" >> "$file"
    echo "Added: $name"
    exit 0
fi

# delete meeting
if [ "$1" = "--delete" ]; then
    name="$2"

    if [ -z "$name" ]; then
        echo "Usage: meet --delete <name>"
        exit 1
    fi

    if ! grep -q "^$name " "$file"; then
        echo "No meeting found: $name"
        exit 1
    fi

    grep -v "^$name " "$file" > "$file.tmp" && mv "$file.tmp" "$file"

    echo "Deleted: $name"
    exit 0
fi

# open directly by name
if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    url=$(grep "^$1 " "$file" | awk '{print $2}')

    if [ -z "$url" ]; then
        echo "No meeting found: $1"
        exit 1
    fi

# interactive mode
else
    choice=$(cat "$file" | fzf)

    [ -z "$choice" ] && exit 0

    url=$(echo "$choice" | awk '{print $2}')
fi

# Launch default browser in background
xdg-open "$url" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/meet
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 1. Add Meetings to your Database
Add new meeting URLs paired with custom, easy-to-remember shorthand names:
```bash
meet --add work https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
meet --add classes https://meet.google.com/xyz-pdqr-lmn
```
This saves the meetings in a plain-text file at `~/.meet/links`.

### 2. Launch Interactively (Fuzzy Selector)
Run `meet` with no arguments to trigger the fuzzy selector. It will list your saved meetings, letting you type and filter interactively using `fzf`:
```bash
meet
```
Pressing `Enter` automatically launches the selection in your default browser using `xdg-open`.

### 3. Launch Directly by Name
If you know the meeting name, pass it directly as an argument to launch instantly:
```bash
meet work
```

### 4. Delete Meetings
Remove old meeting entries from the database:
```bash
meet --delete classes
```
