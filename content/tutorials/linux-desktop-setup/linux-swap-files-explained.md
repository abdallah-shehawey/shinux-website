Swap space is what the kernel falls back to when RAM fills up: inactive memory pages get moved out to disk instead of the system triggering an out-of-memory kill. It's slower than RAM, but it's the difference between a heavy workload merely slowing down versus crashing outright. This walks through creating, securing, and enabling a 16GB swap file.

## Disable Any Existing Swap

Start from a clean slate, especially if replacing or resizing an existing swap file:

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
```

`-a` disables every swap device listed in `/proc/swaps`.

## Allocate the Swap File

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 16G /swapfile
```

`fallocate` pre-allocates the space directly — much faster than the older `dd if=/dev/zero` approach.

## Secure It

Swap can contain data moved straight out of RAM, including things like passwords held in memory — so the file must only be readable by root:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

`600` means read/write for the owner (root) only; no permissions for group or others.

## Format it as Swap

```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

This sets up the file as a Linux swap area so the kernel recognizes it as valid swap storage.

## Enable it for the Current Session

```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

## Make it Persistent Across Reboots

The steps above only take effect until the next reboot. To have it load automatically at boot, add it to `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Verify

```bash
sudo swapon --show    # should list /swapfile with SIZE 16G
free -h                # check the Swap: row for total/used
```

## Removing it Later

```bash
sudo swapoff -v /swapfile
sudo nano /etc/fstab     # delete the /swapfile line
sudo rm /swapfile
```
