`scrcpy` displays and controls an Android phone from a Linux PC, over either USB or Wi-Fi, with low latency and no root required — a solid open-source replacement for tools like Iriun.

## Installation

Prebuilt packages exist for most distros:

```text
Debian / Ubuntu : apt install scrcpy        (often an outdated version in repos)
Arch Linux      : pacman -S scrcpy
Fedora          : dnf copr enable zeno/scrcpy && dnf install scrcpy
Gentoo          : emerge scrcpy
```

For up-to-date package availability across distros, check [repology.org/project/scrcpy/versions](https://repology.org/project/scrcpy/versions).

To build from source on Debian/Ubuntu, the dependencies are:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg libsdl2-2.0-0 adb wget \
                 gcc git pkg-config meson ninja-build libsdl2-dev \
                 libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev \
                 libswresample-dev libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

## Phone Setup

**Enable Developer Options:** Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" 7 times.

**Enable debugging:** Settings → Developer options → turn on both USB debugging and Wireless debugging (Android 11+).

## Method 1 Usb (most Stable)

Connect the phone, accept the debugging prompt it shows, then:

```text
scrcpy
```

The phone screen appears immediately.

## Method 2 Wi-fi

Both phone and PC must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

**Option A — legacy TCP/IP** (doesn't work on every phone):

```text
adb tcpip 5555
adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:5555
adb devices          # verify
scrcpy -e
```

**Option B — Wireless Debugging (recommended, Android 11+):** this is the official, stable method.

On the phone: Settings → Developer options → Wireless debugging → on, then pair the device with the pairing code shown. The phone displays an IP address, a pairing port, and a pairing code.

On the PC:

```text
adb pair <IP_ADDRESS>:<PAIR_PORT>   # enter the pairing code when prompted
adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<CONNECT_PORT>
adb devices                          # verify
scrcpy -e
```

Fully wireless, stable, no cable needed once paired.

## Verifying the Connection

```text
adb devices
```

```html
<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>    device
```

## Useful Scrcpy Options

```ini
scrcpy --camera-facing=front   # use the front camera instead of mirroring the screen
scrcpy -e --bit-rate=4M        # limit bitrate — helps on a weaker Wi-Fi link
scrcpy --max-fps=30            # cap the frame rate
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - USB is always the most stable option; Wi-Fi quality depends on the router and signal strength.
> - Wireless Debugging is preferred over the legacy `adb tcpip 5555` method.
> - No root access is required either way.
