`vidtime` is a small Unix-style command-line tool that prints the duration of video files in `HH:MM:SS` format. It's a good example of wrapping `ffprobe` into something that feels like a native shell command — handling wildcards, filenames with spaces, and multiple files in one call, while doing exactly one thing.

## Requirements

`vidtime` only needs `ffprobe`, which ships with FFmpeg:

```text
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

## Installation

```bash
sudo nano /usr/bin/vidtime
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail

RED="\e[38;5;196m"
RESET="\e[0m"

total=0

if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo -e "${RED}Usage: vidtime <file|pattern> [more files...]${RESET}" >&2
  exit 1
fi

for file in "$@"; do
  if [ ! -e "$file" ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Error: '$file' does not exist${RESET}" >&2
    continue
  fi

  if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Error: '$file' is not a regular file${RESET}" >&2
    continue
  fi

  duration=$(ffprobe -v quiet -show_entries format=duration -of csv="p=0" "$file")
  if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$duration" ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Error: '$file' is not a valid media file${RESET}" >&2
    continue
  fi

  printf "%s: " "$file"
  echo "$duration" | awk '{printf "%02d:%02d:%02d\n",$1/3600,($1%3600)/60,$1%60}'

  secs=$(printf "%.0f" "$duration")
  total=$((total + secs))
done

if [ $total -ne 0 ]; then
  printf "\nTotal: %02d:%02d:%02d\n" $((total/3600)) $(((total%3600)/60)) $((total%60))
  exit 0
else
  exit 1
fi
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/vidtime
```

## Usage

```text
vidtime "Information theory Lec 3.mp4"                     # single file
vidtime "Session 06.mkv" "Session 07.mkv"                    # multiple files
vidtime *.mp4                                                 # wildcards
vidtime *                                                      # everything in a directory
```

## How it Works

- `"$@"` preserves every argument exactly as passed, including ones containing spaces.
- The shell expands any wildcard pattern before `vidtime` ever sees it.
- `ffprobe -show_entries format=duration` extracts the duration in raw seconds.
- `awk` converts that into `HH:MM:SS`, and a running `total` is accumulated and printed at the end.

```text
Session 06 Bash Scripting Essentials.mkv: 01:42:18
Session 07 Linux File System Essentials.mkv: 01:35:04

Total: 03:17:22
```

> **Notes:** filenames with spaces are fully supported since every loop variable stays quoted; a non-existent file is reported and skipped rather than aborting the whole run; and the script creates no temporary files — everything is computed in a single `ffprobe`/`awk` pipeline per file.
