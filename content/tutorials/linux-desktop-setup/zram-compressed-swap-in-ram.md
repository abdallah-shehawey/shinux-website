zram creates a compressed block device that lives entirely in RAM and is typically used as swap. Because it's RAM-backed and compressed, swapping to it is far faster than swapping to disk — it buys extra headroom under memory pressure without the latency hit of a real disk-backed swap file (see the swap-file lesson in this track for the disk-backed alternative).

## Install

**Ubuntu/Debian** uses `zram-tools`:

```bash
sudo apt install zram-tools
sudo systemctl enable --now zramswap.service
```

**Fedora** uses `systemd-zram-generator` instead:

```bash
sudo dnf install zram-generator
```

Fedora may already ship a default zram config — creating a config file overrides those defaults.

## Configure

**Ubuntu/Debian** (`/etc/default/zramswap`):

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/default/zramswap
```

```ini
# Compression algorithm
# speed:        lz4 > zstd > lzo
# compression:  zstd > lzo > lz4
# available algorithms: /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
ALGO=zstd

# Percentage of total RAM to use for zram
PERCENT=75

# Fixed size in MiB (ignored when PERCENT is set)
#SIZE=256

# Swap priority (higher = preferred first)
PRIORITY=100
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart zramswap.service
```

**Fedora** (`/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf`):

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
```

```ini
[zram0]
zram-size = min(ram, 12288)
```

This uses zram up to the size of RAM, capped at 12 GB, with the kernel's default compression algorithm — specifying one explicitly is optional; the default is stable and well-tested.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo reboot
```

## Verify

```bash
swapon --show                         # confirm zram swap is active
zramctl                                # inspect zram devices
cat /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm    # check the active algorithm
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - On Fedora, no manual service start is needed after reboot — the systemd generator sets zram up early at boot.
> - For most desktop workloads, the kernel's default compression algorithm is more than sufficient; there's rarely a need to tune it further.
