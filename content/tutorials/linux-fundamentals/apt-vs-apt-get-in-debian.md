The commands `apt` and `apt-get` are both package management tools used in Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu. While they serve similar purposes, there are important differences in functionality, design, and intended use.

---

## 1. Overview

### **`apt-get`**

- Introduced first (older tool).
    
- Designed for scripting and backward compatibility.
    
- Provides low-level package management operations.
    
- Outputs more technical and verbose information.
    

### **`apt`**

- Introduced later (Ubuntu 16.04+).
    
- Designed for interactive use by end users.
    
- Combines common functions of `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.
    
- Provides cleaner, more user-friendly output.

## 2. Output and User Experience

### **`apt-get`**

- Traditional, verbose output.
    
- Less readable for everyday users.
    
- Better suited for automation and scripts.
    

### **`apt`**

- Clean, simplified output.
    
- Shows progress bars.
    
- Displays additional useful information (e.g., package size, number of upgrades).

## 3. Command Differences

### **Common operations**

Both support installing, upgrading, and removing packages, but syntax differs slightly.

| Operation                  | `apt`              | `apt-get`              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Update package list        | `apt update`       | `apt-get update`       |
| Upgrade installed packages | `apt upgrade`      | `apt-get upgrade`      |
| Full system upgrade        | `apt full-upgrade` | `apt-get dist-upgrade` |
| Install package            | `apt install pkg`  | `apt-get install pkg`  |
| Remove package             | `apt remove pkg`   | `apt-get remove pkg`   |
| Search package             | `apt search pkg`   | `apt-cache search pkg` |
| Show package info          | `apt show pkg`     | `apt-cache show pkg`   |

`apt` merges features from both `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.

## 4. Recommended Use

### **Use `apt` when:**

- You are working interactively.
    
- You want human-friendly output.
    
- You want access to the combined functionality of `apt-get` + `apt-cache`.
    

### **Use `apt-get` when:**

- Writing scripts (because it is stable and backward-compatible).
    
- You need advanced flags not available in `apt`.
    
- You require exact, predictable output.

## 5. Summary

| Feature             | `apt`                          | `apt-get`                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Intended for        | Interactive use                | Scripting & backend tools              |
| Output style        | Clean, readable, progress bars | Verbose, traditional                   |
| Combines apt-cache? | ✅ Yes                          | ❌ No                                   |
| Stability           | Good                           | Very stable (preferred for automation) |
| Introduced          | Newer (Ubuntu 16.04+)          | Older, long-standing                   |

## Final Notes

- `apt` is essentially a **front-end wrapper** around `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.
    
- Both tools still exist, and neither is being removed.
    
- For everyday use: **use `apt`**.
    
- For scripting and automation: **use `apt-get`**.
