## What is TTY?

**TTY** originally stands for **Teletypewriter**. Historically, it referred to physical machines (keyboards + printers) used to interact with computers. Although physical teletypes are gone, the term is still used in Linux to describe **kernel-managed terminals**.

### Modern TTY (Linux Context)

In modern Linux systems:

- A **TTY** is a **virtual console** managed directly by the Linux kernel.
    
- Each TTY represents an independent login session.
    
- You can switch between TTYs using:
    

```
Ctrl + Alt + F1 ... F6
```

These are commonly mapped as:

- `/dev/tty1` → first virtual console
    
- `/dev/tty2` → second virtual console
    
- and so on
    

### Characteristics of TTY

- Works **without a graphical interface**
    
- Available even if X11/Wayland crashes
    
- Ideal for **system recovery and debugging**
    
- Each TTY runs a login service (usually `getty`)
    

### Common TTY Use Cases

- Logging in when the desktop environment fails
    
- Fixing display drivers
    
- System maintenance and rescue mode

## What is PTS?

**PTS** stands for **Pseudo-Terminal Slave**. It represents a **software-emulated terminal** used by terminal emulators and remote connections.

### How PTS Works

A pseudo-terminal consists of two parts:

- **PTMX (master)** → controlled by a terminal emulator or SSH
    
- **PTS (slave)** → behaves like a real terminal to programs
    

When you open a terminal window:

- The system allocates a new PTS device
    
- Example devices:
    
    - `/dev/pts/0`
        
    - `/dev/pts/1`
        

### Characteristics of PTS

- Created **dynamically** when needed
    
- Requires a **terminal emulator** or SSH session
    
- Fully emulates a real terminal interface
    
- Depends on user-space processes, not kernel virtual consoles
    

### Common PTS Use Cases

- GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Alacritty
    
- SSH connections
    
- Docker attached terminals

## Key Differences in Architecture

|Feature|TTY|PTS|
|---|---|---|
|Managed by|Linux kernel|User-space + kernel|
|Creation|Static (boot time)|Dynamic (on demand)|
|Needs GUI|No|Yes (for local use)|
|Stability|Very high|Depends on emulator|
|Recovery safe|Yes|No (if GUI fails)|

---

## Important Commands

Check current terminal:

```bash
tty
```

List logged-in users:

```bash
who
```

Example output:

- `/dev/tty2` → kernel TTY
    
- `/dev/pts/1` → pseudo-terminal
    

---

## Summary

- **TTY** = Kernel virtual console (lowest level, most reliable)
    
- **PTS** = Software-based terminal (flexible, user-friendly)
    
- Both provide terminal interfaces but serve **different layers** of the system

# TTY vs PTS — Step-by-Step with Real-Life Analogy

## 1. Imagine a Big Office Building (Your Computer)

- The **building** = your **computer** (hardware + OS)
    
- The **security system + building rules** = the **Linux kernel**
    

You have two ways to work inside this building:

1. **Fixed desks in a control room** → like **TTYs**
    
2. **Flexible coworking spaces with laptops** → like **PTS**
    

---

## 2. What is a TTY in this Analogy?

### Fixed Control Room Desks (TTY)

- The building has several **fixed desks** in a **control room**.
    
- Each desk has:
    
    - A **chair** (your session)
        
    - A **fixed monitor + keyboard** (direct input/output)
        
- These desks are **numbered**: Desk 1, Desk 2, Desk 3, ...
    

In Linux:

- These desks are **virtual consoles**:
    
    - `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2`, `/dev/tty3`, ...
        
- You move between them with:
    
    - `Ctrl + Alt + F1..F6`
        

### Properties (Why They’re Special)

- Always there as long as the building (kernel) is running
    
- Do **not** depend on fancy equipment (no GUI needed)
    
- Used by **admins** when something goes wrong
    

> If the fancy office network dies, you still have the secure control room.

## 3. What is a PTS in this Analogy?

### Flexible Coworking Laptops (PTS)

Now imagine a large open-office space:

- People sit anywhere with **laptops**.
    
- Each laptop connects to the company’s **internal systems** over the network.
    

In Linux:

- The **laptops** = **terminal emulators / SSH clients** (GNOME Terminal, Konsole, ssh)
    
- Each time you open a terminal window, the system gives you a new **virtual plug** into the system:
    
    - `/dev/pts/0`
        
    - `/dev/pts/1`
        
    - `/dev/pts/2`
        

These are **PTS devices** = Pseudo-Terminal Slaves.

### Properties

- Created **only when needed** (when you open a terminal / SSH session)
    
- Depend on **software**:
    
    - GUI (for local terminals)
        
    - SSH / container runtime (for remote / Docker)
        

> If the GUI crashes, all these laptop sessions disappear — but the control room (TTYs) is still working.

## 4. Side-by-Side in the Analogy

|Real-Life Analogy|Linux Concept|
|---|---|
|Building rules + security|Linux kernel|
|Fixed control-room desks|TTY (`/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2`, ...)|
|Laptops in coworking area|PTS (`/dev/pts/0`, `/dev/pts/1`, ...)|
|Sit at control-room desk|Switch TTY (`Ctrl+Alt+F2`)|
|Open a laptop terminal|Open GNOME Terminal / SSH|
|Desks exist even if power to Wi‑Fi goes|TTY works even if GUI/network is broken|
|Laptops useless if Wi‑Fi / network / power to routers fails|PTS dies if GUI/SSH/session dies|

---

## 5. When Do You Actually See Them?

- Log in on a black full-screen console → **you are on a TTY**
    
    - `tty` command might show: `/dev/tty2`
        
- Open GNOME Terminal / Konsole → **you are on a PTS**
    
    - `tty` command might show: `/dev/pts/1`
        

So:

- **TTY = fixed console inside the OS**
    
- **PTS = software-emulated console via a program**

# Process Flow: kernel → getty → shell → GUI → terminal

Below is a simplified flow of what happens from boot to you typing in a terminal.

## 1. Boot and Kernel

1. You power on the machine.
    
2. Bootloader (GRUB, etc.) loads the **Linux kernel**.
    
3. Kernel starts and:
    
    - Initializes hardware
        
    - Mounts root filesystem
        
    - Starts **PID 1** (usually `systemd`)
        

```text
[Power On]
    ↓
[Bootloader]
    ↓
[Linux Kernel]
    ↓
[PID 1 (systemd)]
```

---

## 2. systemd Starts getty on TTYs

`systemd` (or older `init`) starts **getty** services on several TTYs:

- `getty@tty1.service`
    
- `getty@tty2.service`
    
- ...
    

Each `getty` is attached to a device like `/dev/tty1`.

```text
[systemd]
   ├─ getty@tty1 → /dev/tty1
   ├─ getty@tty2 → /dev/tty2
   └─ getty@tty3 → /dev/tty3
```

`getty` is the program that:

- Displays: `login:`
    
- Waits for username
    
- Hands control to `login` / PAM
    

---

## 3. Login and Shell on TTY

When you enter username + password:

1. `getty` + `login` authenticate you.
    
2. On success, they start your **shell** (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`) on that TTY.
    

```text
/dev/tty2
   ↓  (getty shows login: )
[login]
   ↓  (auth successful)
[bash / zsh shell]
```

Now you are **logged in on a TTY**, directly talking to the kernel via the TTY device.

---

## 4. Starting the GUI from a TTY

From a TTY session (text only), you might run:

- `startx`
    
- or a display manager is started by systemd:
    
    - `gdm`, `sddm`, `lightdm`, etc.
        

Flow:

```text
[Kernel]
  ↓
[systemd]
  ↓
[gdm / sddm / lightdm (Display Manager)]
  ↓
[Desktop Session (GNOME / KDE / XFCE)]
```

The display manager:

- Shows the **graphical login screen**
    
- After login, starts your **desktop environment**
    

---

## 5. Opening a Terminal Emulator (Creating a PTS)

Inside the GUI (GNOME, KDE, etc.):

1. You open **GNOME Terminal** (or Konsole, etc.).
    
2. The terminal emulator asks the kernel for a **pseudo-terminal pair**:
    
    - **Master**: controlled by the terminal emulator program
        
    - **Slave**: `/dev/pts/N` device for programs to use
        
3. The terminal emulator starts your **shell** (bash/zsh) attached to the PTS.
    

```text
[GUI Desktop]
   ↓ (launch)
[Terminal Emulator (e.g., gnome-terminal)]
   ↓ (requests pty)
[Kernel creates PTY pair]
   ├─ Master: handled by terminal emulator
   └─ Slave: /dev/pts/0
   ↓
[Shell (bash/zsh) attached to /dev/pts/0]
```

When you type:

- Keystrokes → terminal emulator → PTY master → PTY slave → shell
    
- Output from shell → PTY slave → PTY master → terminal emulator → drawn on your screen

## 7. Summary in One Sentence

- **TTY**: direct login on kernel virtual consoles — exists even without GUI.
    
- **PTS**: terminal sessions **inside GUI or over network (SSH)** using pseudo-terminals created on demand.
