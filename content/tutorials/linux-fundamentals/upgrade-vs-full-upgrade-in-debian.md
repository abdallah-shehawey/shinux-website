In Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Mint), package upgrades are handled using the `apt` command. Two common commands are:

```
apt upgrade
apt full-upgrade
```

While both commands upgrade packages, they behave differently when dealing with dependencies.

---

## 1. `apt upgrade`

### **Safe upgrade (does NOT remove packages)**

- Upgrades installed packages **only if the upgrade does not require removing any other package**.
    
- If a package upgrade requires adding or removing dependencies, `apt upgrade` **will not perform the upgrade**.
    
- Suitable for everyday use.
    

### **Key characteristics:**

- No package removals.
    
- No major system changes.
    
- Only "safe" upgrades.
    

---

## 2. `apt full-upgrade`

### **Smart / aggressive upgrade (CAN remove packages)**

- Upgrades packages **even if doing so requires removing old packages or installing new dependencies**.
    
- Used when major dependency changes occur (kernel upgrades, big version jumps, new meta-packages, etc.).
    
- Equivalent to the older command: `apt-get dist-upgrade`.
    

### **Key characteristics:**

- May install new dependencies.
    
- May remove conflicting packages.
    
- Handles major system transitions.

## 3. Practical Example

Imagine package `A` needs a new dependency `B`, but installing `B` requires removing old package `C`.

- `apt upgrade` → **Will NOT upgrade A** (because it avoids removing C).
    
- `apt full-upgrade` → **Will upgrade A**, install B, and remove C if necessary.

## 4. Summary Table

| Feature                      | `apt upgrade` | `apt full-upgrade`     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Installs new dependencies    | ✔️ Yes        | ✔️ Yes                 |
| Removes packages             | ❌ No          | ✔️ Yes                 |
| Safe for daily updates       | ✔️ Yes        | ⚠️ Use with caution    |
| Handles major system changes | ❌ No          | ✔️ Yes                 |
| Equivalent old command       | —             | `apt-get dist-upgrade` |

## 5. When to Use Each

### Use **`apt upgrade`** when:

- Doing routine updates.
    
- You want zero package removals.
    
- Stability is more important than having the newest version.
    

### Use **`apt full-upgrade`** when:

- Big system upgrades.
    
- Kernel upgrades.
    
- Meta-package or dependency structure changes.
    
- Upgrading to a new Ubuntu release.

## Final Note

Both commands are safe, but:

- `apt upgrade` = **conservative**
    
- `apt full-upgrade` = **smart/aggressive**
    

Choose based on how much control you want over dependency changes.
