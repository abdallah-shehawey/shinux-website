## 1️⃣ What Wildcards _Really_ Are

Wildcards are **pattern-matching characters expanded by the shell itself**, **not by commands** like `ls`, `cp`, or `rm`.

Example:

```bash
ls *.txt
```

What actually happens:

```text
shell expands *.txt → file1.txt file2.txt
ls file1.txt file2.txt
```

> ⚠️ Commands never see wildcards — they only receive expanded filenames.

---

## 2️⃣ Globbing vs Regular Expressions

|Feature|Wildcards (Globs)|Regex|
|---|---|---|
|Expanded by|Shell|Program|
|Syntax|Simple|Complex|
|Recursive|Limited|Yes|
|Context|Filenames|Text content|

Example confusion:

```bash
ls .*txt      # glob
ls | grep .*txt  # regex
```

---

## 3️⃣ Expansion Order (Very Important)

Shell expansion happens in a defined order:

1. Brace expansion `{}`
    
2. Tilde expansion `~`
    
3. Parameter expansion `$VAR`
    
4. Command substitution `$( )`
    
5. **Pathname expansion (globbing)**
    
6. Quote removal
    

This affects correctness and safety.

---

## 4️⃣ Types of Wildcards (Deep Dive)

### ⭐ Asterisk `*`

- Matches **zero or more characters**
    
- Does NOT cross directory separators (`/`)
    

```bash
*.log
backup*
```

---

### ❓ Question Mark `?`

- Matches **exactly one character**
    

```bash
file?.txt   # file1.txt ✅ | file10.txt ❌
```

---

### 🔤 Character Classes `[ ]`

```bash
file[1-3].txt
file[a-z].txt
```

Advanced:

```bash
file[!0-9].txt   # NOT digits
```

---

## 5️⃣ Brace Expansion `{}` (Not a Wildcard!)

Brace expansion generates strings **before globbing**.

```bash
echo file{1,2,3}.txt
```

Output:

```text
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

Ranges:

```bash
echo {a..d}
echo {01..10}
```

---

## 6️⃣ Advanced Globbing Patterns

Enable extended globbing:

```bash
shopt -s extglob
```

Patterns:

```bash
*.!(txt)      # anything except txt
*@(jpg|png)
```

Requires Bash or Zsh.

---

## 7️⃣ Hidden Files & Dotfiles

- `*` ✅ does NOT match `.hidden`
    
- `.*` ✅ matches dotfiles
    
- `.*` ⚠️ also matches `.` and `..`
    

Safe pattern:

```bash
ls .[^.]*
```

---

## 8️⃣ Recursive Globbing `**`

Enable:

```bash
shopt -s globstar
```

Example:

```bash
ls **/*.c
```

Equivalent (conceptually):

```bash
find . -name "*.c"
```

---

## 9️⃣ Wildcards with Common Commands

```bash
cp *.txt /backup/
rm report[0-9].txt
mv *.log old_logs/
chmod +x *.sh
```

Always test first:

```bash
echo rm *.log
```

---

## 🔟 Wildcards vs `find`

|Use Case|Wildcards|find|
|---|---|---|
|Recursive|❌|✅|
|Size/time filters|❌|✅|
|Performance (small dirs)|✅|❌|

Best practice:

- Use globs for simple cases
    
- Use `find` for complex logic
    

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Quoting & Escaping

### Disable expansion completely:

```bash
echo "*.txt"
```

### Escape a single wildcard:

```bash
echo \*.txt
```

Why important:

```bash
rm "$file"
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Safety Techniques (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Dry run everything:

```bash
echo rm *.log
```

### Fail on no matches:

```bash
shopt -s failglob
```

### Prevent dangerous deletes:

```bash
rm -- -file.txt
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Performance Considerations

- Globbing happens **before execution**
    
- Large directories = memory expansion cost
    
- Use `find` for thousands of files
    

Shell limits:

```bash
getconf ARG_MAX
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Shell Differences

|Feature|sh|bash|zsh|
|---|---|---|---|
|Brace expansion|❌|✅|✅|
|Recursive `**`|❌|✅|✅|
|Extended glob|❌|✅|✅|
|Safer defaults|❌|❌|✅|

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Real-World Use Cases

### Cleanup logs:

```bash
rm /var/log/*.{1,old}
```

### Project setup:

```bash
mkdir -p app/{src,bin,docs,tests}
```

### Batch rename preview:

```bash
echo mv *.jpeg *.jpg
```

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Common Mistakes

❌ Believing commands interpret wildcards  
❌ Forgetting hidden files  
❌ Mixing regex with glob syntax  
❌ Unquoted variables

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Exercises

Beginner:

```bash
ls *.txt
```

Intermediate:

```bash
find . -name "*.log" -mtime -3
```

Advanced:

```bash
shopt -s globstar extglob
ls **/*.!(*.tmp)
```

✅ This guide is designed for **Linux users, sysadmins, DevOps engineers, and shell scripters**.

Understanding globbing gives you **precision, safety, and speed** at the command line.

Happy hacking 🐧
