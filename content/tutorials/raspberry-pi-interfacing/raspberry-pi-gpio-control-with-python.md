This guide provides a complete introduction to using the **General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)** pins on a Raspberry Pi using the `gpiozero` library. It covers hardware basics, pin layouts, and code examples ranging from simple LEDs to interactive button controls.

## ⚡ What is GPIO?

**GPIO** stands for **General Purpose Input Output**. It is the row of 40 metal pins found on the Raspberry Pi board. On the Raspberry Pi, these pins allow the CPU to talk to the outside world using simple electrical signals:

- **LOW (0) → 0V** (Off)
    
- **HIGH (1) → 3.3V** (On)
    

### Pin Types

- **Input:** The Pi reads signals from the outside world (e.g., Is a button pressed? Is the temperature high?).
    
- **Output:** The Pi sends signals to control components (e.g., Turn on an LED, spin a motor).
    

> **⚠️ WARNING:** The Raspberry Pi operates at **3.3 Volts**. Connecting 5V directly to a GPIO pin can permanently damage your board.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Why use `gpiozero`?

`gpiozero` is a high-level Python library designed for beginners and clean code. It hides low-level details (like pin direction setup or pull-up resistors) and makes hardware control safe and readable.

### 1. Installation

The library is usually installed by default on Raspberry Pi OS. If not:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

### 2. Importing Libraries correctly

You can import the whole library, or just the specific parts you need to save memory (recommended).

```python
# Option 1: Import everything (Not recommended for large projects)
import gpiozero 

# Option 2: Efficient Import (Recommended)
from gpiozero import LED, Button
from time import sleep
```

## 💡 Controlling LEDs

### Basic On/Off

This script turns an LED connected to **GPIO 17** (Physical Pin 11) on for 1 second, then off.

```python
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep

# Initialize GPIO 17 as an LED (BCM Numbering)
led = LED(17)

print("Light On!")
led.on()

sleep(1) # Wait for 1 second

print("Light Off!")
led.off()
```

### Interactive User Control

Let the user decide when to turn the light on or off via the keyboard.

> **🧠 Note:** The `input()` function **blocks execution**. This means the program stops and does nothing else while waiting for the user to type. This is generally bad for real-time systems that need to monitor sensors constantly.

```python
from gpiozero import LED

led = LED(17)

print("LED Control: Enter 1 for ON, 0 for OFF. Ctrl+C to exit.")

while True:
    try:
        user_choice = int(input("Command > "))
        
        if user_choice == 1:
            led.on()
            print("LED is ON")
        elif user_choice == 0:
            led.off()
            print("LED is OFF")
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter 0 or 1.")
            
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a number.")
```

## 🤔 Critical Concept: Why use `sleep()`?

You will see `sleep()` used often in GPIO programming. It serves two very different but important purposes:

1. **For Human Visibility (Timing):** Computers execute code in microseconds. If you tell an LED to turn ON and then immediately turn OFF without a pause, it happens so fast that the human eye cannot see it. `sleep(1)` forces the program to pause so you can actually see the light change.
    
2. **For CPU Health (Efficiency):** When using a `while True` loop (like in the "Polling" example below), the processor runs the loop as fast as physically possible—often 100,000+ times per second! This forces the CPU to run at 100% usage, causing the Raspberry Pi to get hot and sluggish.
    
    - **Without sleep:** CPU usage = 100% (Bad 🔥)
        
    - **With `sleep(0.1)`:** CPU usage = ~1% (Good ✅)
        

## 🔘 Using Buttons (Inputs)

There are two ways to handle buttons: **Polling** (checking repeatedly) and **Events** (waiting for an interrupt).

### Method A: Polling (The CPU Heavy Way)

This constantly checks the button state. It uses a lot of processor power unless we add a `sleep`.

```python
from gpiozero import Button
from time import sleep

button = Button(26) # Button connected to GPIO 26

while True:
    if button.is_pressed:
        print("Button is being pressed!")
    else:
        print("Button is released.")
    
    # Crucial: Sleep saves CPU power
    sleep(0.1) 
```

### Method B: Events / Interrupts (The Best Practice)

This is the **best practice** for embedded systems. The program pauses and only "wakes up" when the button is actually clicked. It uses almost 0% CPU while waiting.

```python
from gpiozero import Button, LED
from signal import pause # Required to keep the program running

button = Button(26)
led = LED(17)

# Define callback functions
def say_hello():
    print("Button was pressed!")
    led.on()

def say_goodbye():
    print("Button released.")
    led.off()

# Assign functions to events (Interrupts)
button.when_pressed = say_hello
button.when_released = say_goodbye

print("Waiting for button press...")
pause() # Keeps the script running in an event loop
```

## 🚦 Advanced Logic

### 3-LED Switcher

This example cycles through 3 different LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) using a single button. It demonstrates global variables and logic flow.

**Wiring:**

- LED 1: GPIO 17
    
- LED 2: GPIO 27
    
- LED 3: GPIO 22
    
- Button: GPIO 26
    

```python
from gpiozero import Button, LED
from signal import pause

# Setup components
led1 = LED(17)
led2 = LED(27)
led3 = LED(22)

# 'bounce_time' prevents one click from registering as two
button = Button(26, bounce_time=0.05) 

# State variable
led_index = 0

def switch_led():
    global led_index
    
    # Turn everything off first
    led1.off()
    led2.off()
    led3.off()
    
    # Turn on the correct LED based on index
    if led_index == 0:
        led1.on()
        print("LED 1 Active")
    elif led_index == 1:
        led2.on()
        print("LED 2 Active")
    elif led_index == 2:
        led3.on()
        print("LED 3 Active")
    
    # Increment index, but reset to 0 if it goes above 2
    led_index = led_index + 1
    if led_index > 2:
        led_index = 0

print("Press the button to cycle LEDs...")
button.when_pressed = switch_led

pause()
```

### The "Pro" Version (Optimized Code)

We can make the code above much shorter and cleaner using Python Lists.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from gpiozero import LED, Button
from signal import pause

# 1. Create a list of LEDs
led_pins = [17, 27, 22]
leds = [LED(pin) for pin in led_pins]

# 2. Setup Button with Debouncing
# bounce_time=0.05 ignores repeated signals for 50ms (mechanical noise)
button = Button(26, bounce_time=0.05)

# 3. Logic
current_index = 0

def on_button_pressed():
    global current_index
    
    # Turn off all LEDs
    for led in leds:
        led.off()
        
    # Turn on current LED
    leds[current_index].on()
    print(f"Switched to LED on Pin {led_pins[current_index]}")
    
    # Calculate next index using Modulo (%) math
    # 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 ...
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(leds)

button.when_pressed = on_button_pressed

print("System Ready. Press button to cycle.")
pause()
```

## 📝 Summary & Key Takeaways

1. **Pin Numbering:** `gpiozero` uses **BCM** numbering (e.g., GPIO 17), not physical pin numbers.
    
2. **Voltage:** GPIO logic is **3.3V**. Never connect 5V inputs directly.
    
3. **Efficiency:** Prefer **Interrupts** (`button.when_pressed`) over **Polling** (`while True`) to save CPU cycles.
    
4. **Debouncing:** Mechanical buttons vibrate when pressed, creating "phantom" clicks. Use `bounce_time=0.05` to filter this noise.
