## 1. Downloading Raspberry Pi OS

Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS from the official website:

- **Official Link:** [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ "null")
    
    > **Note:** The OS was previously called "Raspbian", but the official name is now **Raspberry Pi OS**.
    
---
### Installation Methods

You have two main options to flash the OS onto your SD card:

#### A. Using Raspberry Pi Imager **(Recommended)**

Raspberry Pi provides an easy tool, **Raspberry Pi Imager**, which can download and flash the OS automatically.

**Option 1: Install via Repository (Easiest)**

- **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install rpi-imager
    ```
    
- **On Fedora:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install rpi-imager
    ```
    

**Option 2: Manual Installation (.deb Package)** If you prefer downloading the package manually:

1. Download the `.deb` file from the official website.
    
2. Open your terminal in the Downloads folder:
    
    ```bash
    cd $HOME/Downloads/
    ```
    
3. Install it:
    
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i imager_*.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix dependencies if needed
    ```
    

#### B. Manual Installation (ISO)

Alternatively, you can install the OS manually by downloading the image and using a tool like **Rufus** or any other imaging tool to burn it onto the SD card.

---
## 2. Preparing the SD Card

When using the **Raspberry Pi Imager**, after selecting your OS and the target SD card, open the **Settings** menu (Gear Icon) to configure the system before flashing. This is crucial for a "Headless" setup.

### Configuration Settings:

1. **General Settings:**
    
    - **Set hostname:** Give your Pi a unique name.
        
    - **Set username and password:** Essential for security.
        
    - **Configure Wireless LAN:** **(Very Important)** Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and Password so the Pi connects automatically.
        
    - _Additional general settings are optional but recommended._
        
2. **Services:**
    
    - **Enable SSH:** Check this box to allow remote access via command line.
        

**Save the settings and start the installation (Write/Flash).**

---
## 3. First Boot & SSH Access

After powering on the Raspberry Pi, you can connect to it via SSH using the terminal:

```bash
ssh username@hostname.local
```

_(Replace `username` and `hostname` with what you configured)._

### Finding Raspberry Pi IP Address (Troubleshooting)

If you don't know the IP address or `hostname.local` doesn't work, you can use **Angry IP Scanner**.

**1. Download:** [https://angryip.org/download/#linux](https://angryip.org/download/#linux "null")

**2. Prerequisites (Java):** Angry IP Scanner requires Java (OpenJDK 11 or later).

- **On Fedora/RedHat:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk-devel
    ```
    
- **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
    ```
    
- **On Arch Linux:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S jdk11-openjdk
    ```
    
    _(Verify installation with `java -version`)_.
    

**3. Installing Angry IP Scanner:**

- **For Ubuntu/Debian (.deb):**
    
    ```bash
    cd $HOME/Downloads/
    sudo dpkg -i ipscan_*.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f # Fix dependencies
    ```
    
- **For fedora/redhat (.rpm):**
	
  ```bash
	cd $HOME/Downloads/
    sudo rpm -i ipscan_*.deb
  ```
	
- **Running the Executable Jar:** If you use the Jar version, run: `java -jar <jar-file>`. _(Note: You may need the `swt.jar` from the Eclipse SWT Project in your classpath)._
    

**4. Scanning the Network:**

- Open Angry IP Scanner (`ipscan` in terminal).
    
- **Tip:** Sort results by **Ping**.
    
- Locate your Raspberry Pi and use its IP to connect.
    
- _Note for 32-bit ARM users:_ You might need an older 32-bit build of SWT.

## 4. Connecting with GUI (VNC)

If you want to access your Raspberry Pi using a graphical desktop, you can use **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)**.

### Choosing a VNC Viewer: TigerVNC vs. RealVNC

|Feature|TigerVNC|RealVNC Viewer|
|---|---|---|
|**Type**|Open-source|Proprietary (Free for personal use)|
|**Interface**|Utilitarian, functional|User-friendly, polished|
|**Best For**|Performance, Linux purists|Ease of use, beginners|

### Step 1: Install a VNC Viewer on Your PC

#### Option A: Install TigerVNC (Open Source)

- **On Fedora:** `sudo dnf install tigervnc`
    
- **On Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-viewer`
    
- **To Run:** Type `vncviewer` or `tigervnc` in the terminal.
    

#### Option B: Install RealVNC Viewer (User Friendly)

1. Download from: [https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/linux/](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/linux/ "null")
    
2. **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i VNC-Viewer-*-Linux-x64.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```
    
3. **On Fedora/RedHat:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -ivh VNC-Viewer-*-Linux.rpm
    ```
    

### Step 2: Enable VNC on the Raspberry Pi

Connect to your Pi via terminal/SSH and run:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Follow this exact order to enable it correctly:

1. **Enable Desktop Auto-Login:**
    
    - Go to **System Options** -> **Boot / Auto Login**.
        
    - Select **Desktop Autologin** (Desktop GUI).
        
    - _(This ensures the desktop environment loads so VNC can see it)._
        
2. **Enable VNC Server:**
    
    - Go to **Interface Options** -> **VNC**.
        
    - Select **Yes** (Enable).
        
3. **Finish & Reboot.**
    

### Step 3: Connect Through VNC Viewer

1. Open your VNC Viewer.
    
2. Enter the **IP address** of your Raspberry Pi.
    
3. Enter your Raspberry Pi **username and password**.
    
4. You now have full GUI access.

## 5. Remote Access via Web (Raspberry Pi Connect)

**Raspberry Pi Connect** allows you to access your device's desktop directly from a web browser anywhere, without needing to configure port forwarding or VNC.

### Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi Connect Service

On your Raspberry Pi terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt install rpi-connect
```

### Step 2: Generate Verification Link

Start the sign-in process:

```bash
# if it not enable enabel it at first
rpi-connect on
# and after that
rpi-connect signin
```

### Step 3: Link Your Device

1. The terminal will generate a unique **verification URL**.
    
2. Copy this link and paste it into a web browser on your computer.
    
3. Sign in with your **Raspberry Pi ID** (or create one) to link the device.
    
4. Once linked, access your Pi remotely via the web dashboard.

## 6. Network Fallback: Creating a Wireless Hotspot

If you need to move your Raspberry Pi to a new location where the configured Wi-Fi is unavailable (e.g., from home to work), you can configure the Pi to broadcast its own Hotspot as a backup.

### Steps to Configure (via GUI/VNC):

1. **Create the Hotspot:**
    
    - Click the **Network Icon** in the system tray (top right).
        
    - Select **Advanced Options** -> **Create Wireless Hotspot**.
        
    - Follow the prompts to create a normal hotspot.
        
    - **Connect Laptop:** Connect your laptop to this new Hotspot network.
        
    - **Find Gateway IP:** Open **Angry IP Scanner** (or check your connection details). The **Gateway IP** address you see is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. Use this IP to connect via SSH or VNC.
        
2. **Make it Persistent (Fallback Mode):**
    
    - By default, the hotspot might not restart automatically after a reboot. To fix this:
        
    - Go back to **Advanced Options** -> **Edit Connections**.
        
    - Double-click on the hotspot profile you just created.
        
    - Go to the **General** tab.
        
    - Check the box for **Connect automatically with priority**.
        
    - Set the **Priority** to `0`.
        
3. **Switch to Local Wi-Fi:**
    
    - Once connected to the Pi via the Hotspot, you can connect it to the new location's internet.
        
    - Click the **Network Icon**.
        
    - Select the local Wi-Fi network (or choose **Connect to Hidden Wireless Network** if applicable).
        
    - Since the Hotspot has priority 0, the Pi will prefer this new connection next time it boots if available.
        

### Why set Priority to 0?

This tells the Raspberry Pi to search for your known Wi-Fi networks (which have a higher default priority) first. If it cannot find them (because you changed location), it will fall back to Priority `0`, start the Hotspot, and allow you to connect to it directly to reconfigure your settings.

---
## 7. Connect over Ethernet (Internet Sharing)

If you don't have Wi-Fi, you can connect the Raspberry Pi directly to your laptop via an Ethernet cable and share your laptop's internet connection.

### Step 1: Configure Your Laptop (Linux)

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Network**.
    
2. Find the **Wired** connection section and click the **+** (plus) icon to add a new profile.
    
3. **Identity Tab:** Give it a name (e.g., "Shared RPi").
    
4. **IPv4 Tab:**
    
    - Change "IPv4 Method" to **Shared to other computers**.
        
    - _(This allows your laptop to act as a router for the Pi, giving it an IP address and internet access)._
        
5. Save/Apply the settings.
    

### Step 2: Connect and Find IP

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi to your laptop using an Ethernet cable.
    
2. The Pi should now have an internet connection bridged from your laptop.
    
3. To find the Pi's IP address:
    
    - Open **Angry IP Scanner**.
        
    - Select your Ethernet interface in the preferences (or scan the local range).
        
    - Look for the Pi's hostname.
        
4. Alternatively, try connecting directly via SSH:
    
    ```bash
    ssh username@hostname.local
    ```

## 8. Connect to Raspberry Pi from Different Wi‑Fi Networks (Using Tailscale)

Access your Raspberry Pi securely from _any network_ without needing port‑forwarding, static IP, or router access.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Install Tailscale on Raspberry Pi

Open terminal on the Raspberry Pi and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

It will generate a **login link** → open it and sign in using Google / GitHub.

> 🔥 Make sure you use the **same account** on both Raspberry Pi and your laptop/phone.

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Install Tailscale on Your Laptop / PC

Run the same commands on your laptop (Linux/macOS). On Windows, simply download the Tailscale app and sign in.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Get Your Private Tailscale IP

On **Raspberry Pi**:

```bash
tailscale ip
```

On **Laptop/PC**:

```bash
tailscale status
```

You will get an IP like:

```
100.x.x.x
```

This is your secure private network address.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Connect via SSH

From your laptop:

```bash
ssh pi@100.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Default user (if not changed):

```bash
username: pi
password: raspberry
```

> 🔐 If you changed the username or enabled passwordless SSH, use your configuration instead.
