-- Avatar uploads: a public `avatars` bucket, one object per user at
-- `<user_id>/avatar` (upsert on re-upload, so there's never more than one file
-- per user). Public read (served straight from the CDN URL); write access is
-- restricted to the owning user via the folder-name convention.
-- Run this once via the Supabase SQL Editor, same as 0001_init.sql.
